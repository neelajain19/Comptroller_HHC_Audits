Audit Recommendations

Based","Pharmacy Department at Harlem Hospital Center was approximately $8.4 million, and the value
of the inventory of all drugs in the Pharmacy Department stockroom at the end of Fiscal Year
2005 was reported to be $240,957.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

Overall, Harlem Hospital Center’s Pharmacy Department has adequate inventory controls
over noncontrolled drugs. Based on our observations and testing, we found that access to the
Main Pharmacy, stockroom, satellites, and Out-Patient Pharmacy (OPD) is restricted to specific
employees. Cameras are installed in all Pharmacy areas to observe their activities. Vendors
deliver noncontrolled drugs directly to the stockroom where an employee counts and signs for
the number of cases received. Noncontrolled drugs are delivered to OPD and the four satellites
in locked containers. Documentation for noncontrolled drugs that were issued from the
stockroom is maintained in the stockroom files, and inventory records had only minor
inaccuracies.

However, we identified some issues at the Pharmacy Department that must be addressed.
Specifically: the count sheets used by Harlem Hospital Center staff members to perform their
year-end inventory listed the quantities for each item, contrary to good inventory control
practice; adjustments made to the computerized Other Than Personal Services (OTPS)
procurement management system did not always have back-up documentation; the Pharmacy did
not adequately segregate the duties of the stockroom employees; procedures for purchasing of
drugs were not always followed; and the credits and checks for returned expired drugs were not
reconciled.

Office of New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MH05_130A_page_5
Audit Recommendations

Based on our findings, we make 10 recommendations including those listed below.
Harlem Hospital Center Pharmacy officials should:

Remind all Pharmacy personnel who have access to noncontrolled drugs after the
stockroom is closed that they are required to prepare an issue sheet for all
noncontrolled drugs removed from the stockroom.

Ensure that all count sheets used for the year-end inventory do not have balances
listed on them.

Investigate and document all adjustments made to correct inventory balances in
OTPS.

Adhere to their own purchasing procedures and ensure that all purchase orders are
prepared, approved, and authorized before drugs are ordered from vendors.

Perform reconciliations to ensure that they receive all credits and moneys they are
entitled to.

Objective

Our audit objective was to determine whether the internal controls over Harlem Hospital
Center’s inventory of noncontrolled drugs were adequate.

Scope and Methodology

The scope period of this audit was Fiscal Year 2005 (July 1, 2004 — June 30, 2005) and
July 2005 through September 2005. To achieve our audit objectives, we reviewed the following
HHC documents and procedures for inventory verification for Fiscal Year 2005, including: the
Inventory Procedure Manual; Operating Procedure No. 140-2, “Repackaging of Drugs, Proper
Labeling and Maintaining of Appropriate Records”; Operating Procedure No. 140-1,
“Requisitioning Drugs and Pharmaceuticals”; Operating Procedure No. 140-6, “Requisitioning

' Drugs are categorized into two groups: controlled and noncontrolled. Controlled drugs are regulated by
the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), a federal law-enforcement agency that has strict
requirements for storage, record keeping, and dispensing of controlled drugs. The DEA, however, does not
regulate noncontrolled drugs.

of Drugs and Pharmaceuticals for Ward, Clinic, Emergency Room and All Other Medication
Areas”; Operating Procedure No. 110-24, “Unauthorized Procurements”; and, Operating
Procedure No. 110-1, “Procurement of Supplies, Services and Equipment.” We also interviewed
hospital officials, including the Director of the Pharmacy.

Prior audits performed by our office on inventory controls over noncontrolled drugs at
other HHC facilities were reviewed to determine if there were any recurring issues in the various
facilities.

We reviewed the policies and procedures issued by the Pharmacy Department covering
the following subjects: purchasing; receiving drugs from vendors; ordering from the stockroom
by inpatient pharmacies and Out-Patient Pharmacy (OPD); disposition of unused and expired
drugs; stockroom security; and the annual count of the inventory in the Pharmacy stockroom.

To determine whether the above policies and procedures were followed, observations at
each area operated by the Pharmacy Department, including the OPD, the Main Pharmacy, and
satellite pharmacies were performed. These observations included an assessment of the security
at each area.

To familiarize ourselves with the operations at the Pharmacy Department, auditing staff
performed a walk-through of all areas of the Pharmacy including the OPD, the Main Pharmacy,
and satellite pharmacies. They also interviewed the personnel at these locations.

To assess the hospital’s internal controls over noncontrolled drugs, we prepared detailed
flow charts of the movement of noncontrolled drugs. We observed the delivery and receipt of
noncontrolled drugs at the Pharmacy stockroom; the storage of the noncontrolled drugs on",10957,1371

yet recorded at","over expired noncontrolled
drugs. At each Pharmacy subdivision, we observed the preparation of the patients’ individual
drug-dispensing containers and the receipt and storage of noncontrolled drugs ordered from the
stockroom. We also accompanied personnel as they delivered the drugs to the nurses’ stations.

To determine whether the Pharmacy Department follows its own purchasing procedures
for noncontrolled drugs, we selected a random sample of 58 from a total of 426 purchase orders
that were prepared by the Pharmacy staff from April 1, 2005, through June 30, 2005 (the most
current available purchases). Five of the purchase orders in our sample were not reviewed
because they had been cancelled.

To determine whether there was an adequate accounting of noncontrolled drugs, we
observed the 2005 Fiscal year-end inventory count performed by hospital staff in the Pharmacy
stockroom on June 27, 2005, and June 28, 2005, and the verification of the count by the HHC
internal auditors on June 30, 2005. In addition, on September 13, 2005, we conducted our own
physical inventory count of noncontrolled drugs in the Pharmacy stockroom. From the OTPS
perpetual inventory listing dated August 17, 2005, we randomly selected a sample of 435
noncontrolled drugs, valued at $93,630, from a total population of 1,523, totaling $384,408. We
eliminated 90 items with zero stock balances; therefore, our final sample was 345. We also
adjusted the OTPS recorded inventory balances to reflect the issuances and receipts that were not

yet recorded at the time of our inventory count. We then compared the inventory count results to
the adjusted, recorded balances in OTPS.

To test inventory adjustments, we reviewed all 288 adjustments made to OTPS from
January 2005 through June 2005, to determine whether the adjustments were appropriate. This
period was selected since it was the most current available information on adjustments. In
addition, we examined written explanations and supporting documentation relating to these
adjustments to determine whether an investigation was performed for these adjustments.

To determine whether the Pharmacy Department maintains adequate documentation to
support the issuances of the noncontrolled drugs from the stockroom to various locations, we
randomly selected a sample of 50 from a total population of 1,665 noncontrolled drugs on the
OTPS printout received from Pharmacy officials on May 25, 2005. We reviewed reports of the
transactions that transpired from December 2004 through May 2005 for our sample of 50
noncontrolled drugs and found that 256 issue sheets” were prepared. We reviewed the respective
files to determine whether these 256 issue sheets were present.

The results of the above tests, while not projected to their respective populations,
provided a reasonable basis for us to assess the adequacy of the inventory controls.

This audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards (GAGAS) and included tests of the records and other auditing procedures considered
necessary. It was performed in accordance with the audit responsibilities of the City

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Overall, Harlem Hospital Center’s Pharmacy Department has adequate inventory controls
over noncontrolled drugs. Based on our observations and testing, we found that access to the
Main Pharmacy, stockroom, satellites, and OPD is restricted to specific employees. Cameras are
installed in all Pharmacy areas to observe their activities. Wendors deliver noncontrolled drugs
directly to the stockroom where an employee counts and signs for the number of cases received.
Noncontrolled drugs are delivered to OPD and the four satellites in locked containers.
Documentation for noncontrolled drugs that were issued from the stockroom is maintained in the
stockroom files, and inventory records had only minor inaccuracies.

However, we identified some issues at the Pharmacy Department that must be addressed.
The count sheets used by Harlem Hospital Center staff members to perform their year-end
inventory listed the quantities for each item, contrary to good inventory control practice;
adjustments made to OTPS did not always have back-up documentation; the Pharmacy did not
adequately segregate the duties of the stockroom employees; procedures for purchasing of drugs
were not always followed; and the credits and checks for returned expired drugs were not
reconciled.

These observations and findings are discussed in detail in the following sections of the
report.

reconciled.

These observations and findings are discussed in detail in the following sections of the
report.

Pharmacy Department has Adequate Controls
Over the Noncontrolled Drugs in its Stockroom

Safeguarding of Pharmacy Areas

Harlem Hospital Center’s Pharmacy Department has adequate controls over access to the
Main Pharmacy, stockroom, satellites, and OPD. Access to these areas is restricted to specific
employees who must use an electronic card or a key to get in to these areas. In addition, non-
stockroom employees are prevented from entering or leaving the stockroom without an
authorized person opening the door.

Furthermore, cameras are located in all areas of the Pharmacy to record all activities.
The Director of the Pharmacy maintains the monitors in his office.

Procedures for Noncontrolled Drug Deliveries to the Stockroom

Controls over delivery of noncontrolled drugs to the stockroom are adequate. Vendors
deliver noncontrolled drugs to the Pharmacy Department daily. These deliveries go directly to
the stockroom where an employee counts and signs for the number of cases received. The
employee opens each case, counts the number of items received, and checks the items against the
invoice or packing slip. The quantity, lot number, and expiration date for each noncontrolled
drug is recorded on the invoice. The employee then places the noncontrolled drugs on the shelf

6 Office of New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MH05_130A_page_10
and updates the information on the appropriate inventory stock card. The quantity of
noncontrolled drugs received is also updated in OTPS.

Issuance of Noncontrolled Drugs to Different Areas of the Pharmacy

Controls over the issuance of noncontrolled drugs to the satellites and OPD are adequate.
The satellites and OPD prepare their own requests for noncontrolled drugs by filling out issue
sheets listing the noncontrolled drugs that are needed. The issue sheets are then brought to the
stockroom where a stockroom employee removes the noncontrolled drugs from the shelves and
places them in locked containers.

The locked containers for the satellite pharmacies are delivered by a stockroom
employee. A pharmacist at the satellites reconciles the noncontrolled drugs received to the
information on the issue sheet. The locked containers for OPD are picked up from the
stockroom by an OPD employee. The OPD employee signs a Medication Movement form to
confirm the number of locked containers that were picked up. In both instances the issue sheets
are signed by a pharmacist and returned to the stockroom where the information from the issue
sheet is entered into OTPS.

Documentation for Noncontrolled Drugs Issued

Controls over the maintenance of documentation for noncontrolled drugs issued are
adequate. We found 255 (99.6%) of the 256 sampled issue sheets in the files kept in the

stockroom. Issue sheets were grouped in folders by the month the noncontrolled drug was
issued. The issue sheets are important since they are the only source documents",19696,2705
Comptroller_Reports/MH05_130A.pdf,1,William,William Brown,70.0,lemma,"7 Office of New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MH05_130A_page_11
Recommendation

1. Harlem","source documents that indicate
where and to whom the noncontrolled drugs were delivered. These documents can be used by
Pharmacy employees to investigate discrepancies found in OTPS.

Minor Inaccuracies in Inventory Records of Noncontrolled Drugs

Based on our physical count, we found that 319 (92.5%) of the 345 noncontrolled drugs
in our sample matched the balances recorded in OTPS. The remaining 26 discrepancies, totaling
$3,487, represent 3.7 percent of the total dollar value of our sample ($93,630). Pharmacy
officials provided us with supporting documentation to account for 16 (62%) of the 26
discrepancies.

Although there were no supporting documents for the remaining 10 discrepancies,
Pharmacy officials stated that the Main Pharmacy is open 24 hours a day but the stockroom room
is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. When the stockroom is closed,
supervising pharmacists have access to the stockroom and can remove the drugs from the
shelves. Not all supervising pharmacists fill out an issue sheet when they remove noncontrolled
drugs from the stockroom during off hours. However, they may note the noncontrolled drugs
they removed from the shelves on the inventory stock card. In fact, during their review of the
discrepancies we identified, Pharmacy officials found instances where inventory stock cards had
entries for noncontrolled drugs issued but for which no issue sheets were available. Issue sheets
are important since they are the source of the entries entered in OTPS.

7 Office of New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MH05_130A_page_11
Recommendation

1. Harlem Hospital Center Pharmacy officials should remind all Pharmacy personnel
who have access to noncontrolled drugs after the stockroom is closed that they are
required to prepare an issue sheet for all noncontrolled drugs removed from the
stockroom.

HHC Response: HHC agreed stating, “Department of Pharmacy has strictly mandated
Tour I and III supervisors to follow and record accordingly any off-hour stock room
movement. The Department has also revised Policy and Procedure regarding Stockroom
medication Discrepancy Report Form.”

Count Sheets Used for the Year-end Inventory
Had Preprinted Quantities and Were Not Reconciled

As required by HHC, Pharmacy officials conducted their Fiscal Year 2005 year-end
inventory count on June 27, 2005, and June 28, 2005. As part of our audit, we observed the
inventory count and found two areas where improvement could be made.

Although the inventory cards were locked away as required, the count sheets used to
perform the inventory count had the quantity of each item listed on them. This is contrary to
good inventory control practice, since the person who is performing the count should not have a
written quantity already available while performing an inventory count. Additionally, once the

count was completed, the Pharmacy staff members did not reconcile the multiple copies of the
count sheets to ensure that every item on the sheets was counted.

After the count was completed by Harlem Hospital Center Pharmacy staff members, we
reviewed and reconciled the count sheets to determine whether",22844,3204

written quantity already available while performing an inventory count. Additionally, once the

count was completed, the Pharmacy staff members did not reconcile the multiple copies of the
count sheets to ensure that every item on the sheets was counted.

After the count was completed by Harlem Hospital Center Pharmacy staff members, we
reviewed and reconciled the count sheets to determine whether all items listed were counted. We
found that 17 (1%) of 1,631 noncontrolled drugs were not counted. We provided the Pharmacy
officials with a list of these 17 noncontrolled drugs, which were valued at $6,205. They stated
that seven of these noncontrolled drugs, valued at $4,927, were not part of the stockroom
inventory. Upon receipt of these noncontrolled drugs, the drugs are immediately issued to the
Main Pharmacy and placed in the unlocked refrigerators that are maintained outside the
stockroom area. However, these noncontrolled drugs are not solely for Main Pharmacy use but
are also used by other Pharmacy areas; therefore, these drugs should be part of the inventory and
included in the year-end count.

Recommendations
Harlem Hospital Center Pharmacy officials should:

2. Ensure that all count sheets used for the year-end inventory count do not have
balances listed on them.

HHC Response: HHC agreed stating, “Department of Pharmacy created new inventory
‘Count Sheet’ form eliminating any inventory balances.”

8 Office of New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MH05_130A_page_12
3. Reconcile all count sheets at the end of the year-end inventory count to ensure that all
items are counted.

HHC Response: HHC agreed stating, “Department of Pharmacy created a new inventory
‘Count Sheet’ form that will be implemented at the end of fiscal year 2006. A supervisor
will be responsible for ensuring all Count Sheets are accounted for at the conclusion of
each year-end inventory count.”

4. Ensure that noncontrolled drugs kept in the refrigerators are included in the
stockroom inventory listing and placed inside the secured stockroom area.

HHC Response: HHC agreed stating, “Pharmacy has purchased two extra refrigerators
for the secured stockroom that will be used to maintain inventory for refrigerated items in
the stockroom area.”

Undocumented Adjustments Made to OTPS Records

From January 2005 through June 2005, 288 adjustments were made to OTPS records. Of
those, 152 were adjustments made to record the receipt of free drugs from the Department of
Health or for the Patient Assistance Program. These free drugs cannot be entered as purchases
and were therefore entered as adjustments.

The remaining 136 adjustments were made to OTPS to correct errors found in the
inventory balances. Pharmacy officials stated that every adjustment is investigated and the
results of the investigation are documented in a memo to the Director of Pharmacy. We found
that the investigation results for 120 (88%) adjustments were documented. The remaining 16
(12%) adjustments lacked documentation to verify that an investigation was performed. Table I",25528,3626

We brought these undocumented adjustments to the attention of the Stockroom
Supervisor who subsequently investigated the reasons for them and provided us with
explanations and/or documentation for all of them. However, these explanations and the
documentation were not included in the monthly memorandum to the Director of Pharmacy
informing him of the adjustments made to OTPS during the month. To ensure that errors or
misappropriations do not go undetected, all adjustments should be investigated and documented.

Recommendation

5. Harlem Hospital Center Pharmacy officials should investigate and document all
adjustments made to correct inventory balances in OTPS.

HHC Response: HHC agreed stating, “Pharmacy Department’s Purchasing section has
the responsibility of dealing with matters of stockroom discrepancies. The following
policy has been strictly implemented: (1) Stockroom supervisor will generate a
discrepancy report if there is a discrepancy occurrence with resolution suggestions. (2)
This report will be reviewed by the Director of Pharmacy and if the suggestions are
approved, then the Purchasing Supervisor will make the appropriate approved
adjustments in the OTPS system. (3) Documentation will be kept on file in accordance
with HHC record requirements.”

Lack of Segregation of Duties in Pharmacy Department

The Pharmacy Department does not adequately segregate the duties of its stockroom
staff. As part of our review of the Pharmacy’s internal controls, we observed that one stockroom
employee prepares the noncontrolled drug orders for the three areas of Main Pharmacy; removes
the noncontrolled drugs requested from the stockroom shelves; delivers the",27459,3930

Harlem Hospital","in accordance
with HHC record requirements.”

Lack of Segregation of Duties in Pharmacy Department

The Pharmacy Department does not adequately segregate the duties of its stockroom
staff. As part of our review of the Pharmacy’s internal controls, we observed that one stockroom
employee prepares the noncontrolled drug orders for the three areas of Main Pharmacy; removes
the noncontrolled drugs requested from the stockroom shelves; delivers the noncontrolled drugs;
and stocks the Main Pharmacy shelves. In addition, the same employee enters the records of
these actions in OTPS. We also observed that another Pharmacy employee who is responsible
for entering inventory information regarding purchases and receipts into the OTPS computer is
located in the stockroom, with access to the noncontrolled drugs.

Comptroller's Directive #1 concerning internal controls requires that the responsibility
for “the use of physical inventories [should be] . . . segregated from . . . the maintenance of
detailed [inventory] records.” Good internal controls require that persons receiving and issuing
inventory items should not be responsible for maintaining the records of those items. We believe
it is in the Pharmacy Department’s best interest to ensure that there are appropriate controls in
place to give management reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from
unauthorized use or disposition, and that transactions are properly recorded.

Lack of appropriate segregation of duties among employees in an organization can allow
errors or irregularities to occur without detection. The Pharmacy Department should ensure that
all duties are adequately segregated.

10 Office of New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MH05_130A_page_14
Recommendations
Harlem Hospital Center Pharmacy officials should:

6. Require all subdivisions of the Pharmacy that dispense noncontrolled drugs to prepare
their drug orders.

HHC Response: HHC agreed stating, “Intra-Departmental ordering sub-division is
responsible for the non-controlled substance active stock minimum levels. The following
policy has been mandated: (1) Designated sub-division pharmacist will check his/her par
level and will be responsible to provide out-of-stock order form list to the Pharmacy
stockroom. (2) Stockroom will handle these request forms appropriately based on the
availability of requested medications.”

7. Ensure that the stockroom personnel have read-only access to the inventory
information in the computer system.

HHC Response: HHC agreed stating, “The OTPS computer system has been revised as
follows: (1) Only stockroom supervising pharmacist designated by the Director of
Pharmacy will be able to change any data in the OTPS system via special security code
access. (2) All other stockroom staff will have ‘read only’ access to the OTPS system.”

8. Ensure that Pharmacy employees who enter inventory information in OTPS do not
have access to the noncontrolled drugs in the stockroom.

HHC Response: HHC agreed stating, “During the interim, Pharmacy employee requiring
access to the OTPS system will have to use access terminals located outside of
stockroom. CFO has directed the Director of Pharmacy to relocate terminal to his office.
The move of the OTPS access terminal will be coordinated as a priority with Pharmacy
and MIS.”

The move of the OTPS access terminal will be coordinated as a priority with Pharmacy

Guidelines Are Not Always Followed
Regarding Purchases of Noncontrolled Drugs

The Pharmacy Department does not always adhere to its own procedures regarding
purchasing of noncontrolled drugs. Specifically, we found that 52 (98%) purchase orders,
totaling $257,663 of the 53 (totaling $260,430) in our sample were generated at least one day
after the noncontrolled drugs were ordered. In fact, one purchase order was generated 39 days
after the order was placed.

According to Harlem Hospital Center’s “General Pharmacy Purchasing, Pharmacy Policy
PA-1”: “The purchase order shall be placed . . . on the day the purchase order is generated.”
Discussions with the Director of the Pharmacy and the Supervisor of Purchasing for the
Pharmacy stated that the Budget Department has to approve the requisitions prior to generating
the purchase order. However, to expedite the purchasing process of needed drugs, the Pharmacy

11 Office of New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MH05_130A_page_15
Department always orders the drugs prior to the approval of the requisition by the Budget
Department. Once the requisition has been approved, the Pharmacy Department will generate
the purchase order, usually one or two days after the actual order has been placed.

By allowing noncontrolled drugs to be ordered before a purchase order is prepared, the
Pharmacy Department is circumventing the controls it put in place to ensure that only drugs that
have been approved and authorized will be ordered and purchased.

Recommendation

9. Harlem Hospital Center Pharmacy officials should adhere to their own purchasing
procedures and ensure that all purchase orders are prepared, approved, and authorized
before drugs are ordered from vendors.

HHC Response: HHC agreed stating, “The following adjustments have been made to
insure the proper processing of Pharmacy’s purchase orders: (1) Pharmacy Director has
reissued HHC operating Procedures. (2) The Finance Office-Audit Unit will conduct
audit reviews to ensure all procedures for purchases are followed.”

The Monetary Value of Expired Noncontrolled Drugs Is Not Reconciled

The Pharmacy Department does not perform reconciliations of the credits and checks
received from the vendors for the expired noncontrolled drugs that have been returned. As a
result, Harlem Hospital Center officials cannot be assured that they are receiving the correct
credits and moneys that they are entitled to. According to available vendor documentation for
Fiscal Year 2005, Harlem Hospital Center should have received credits and moneys totaling
$224,303. However, because the Pharmacy Department does",33047,4760

Recommendation

10","and moneys that they are entitled to. According to available vendor documentation for
Fiscal Year 2005, Harlem Hospital Center should have received credits and moneys totaling
$224,303. However, because the Pharmacy Department does not perform reconciliations, we are
unable to ascertain the dollar amount of the credits and moneys it received.

According to the Associate Coordinating Manager at the Pharmacy, staff members of
stockroom and the different subdivisions of the Pharmacy review the expiration dates of the
noncontrolled drugs each month. When they find a noncontrolled drug that has expired or will
expire within the month, they set the drug aside in a separate section of the stockroom where it
will be picked up by Guaranteed Returns, a company under contract with HHC that returns
expired drugs to their manufacturers or destroys the drugs that cannot be returned. A
representative of Guaranteed Returns scans the expired noncontrolled drugs into the company’s
computer system in the presence of a Pharmacy staff member. The representative then gives the
Pharmacy staff member the list of the scanned noncontrolled drugs that were picked up. Every
three months, the hospital receives a manifest that lists all the drugs picked up, the credits to
purchase additional drugs, and/or moneys due the hospital. At a later date, these credits and
moneys are sent to the hospital. Harlem Hospital Center officials do not know whether they
received the correct credits and moneys since they do not perform reconciliations.

Audit Report on the New York City Health + Hospitals’
Controls over Inventory of Medical Surgical Supplies
Including Personal Protective Equipment at Its
Post-acute and Long-term Acute Care Facilities

MG21-059A
EE __________________ ____—————___|
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This audit was conducted to determine whether New York City (City) Health + Hospitals (H+H)""
ensures that its facilities comply with applicable inventory rules and guidelines regarding its
management of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical surgical supplies.

H+H is a public benefit corporation and is the largest municipal health system in the country. H+H
manages","manages five post-acute/long-term care facilities (facilities) that operate as licensed nursing
homes and are required to follow New York State Department of Health (SDOH) regulations.

PPE falls under six general categories—gloves, gowns, shoe covers, face shields, caps, and
masks (surgical and N95). H+H utilizes a computer-based program called PeopleSoft to manage
their medical surgical inventory, including ordering and end user distribution, as well as the
management of inventory records of medical surgical items.

The total medical surgical supply purchases for the five facilities for Fiscal Year 2021 totaled
$11,474,698.27.

Audit Findings and Conclusion

H+H has established several inventory rules and guidelines relating to the supply and
management of medical surgical supplies at its facilities. However, the agency does not ensure

Audit Report on the New York City Health + Hospitals’
Controls over Inventory of Medical Surgical Supplies
Including Personal Protective Equipment at Its

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This audit was conducted to determine whether New York City (City) Health + Hospitals (H+H)""

management of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical surgical supplies.

H+H is a public benefit corporation and is the largest municipal health system in the country. H+H
manages five post-acute/long-term care facilities (facilities) that operate as licensed nursing
homes and are required to follow New York State Department of Health (SDOH) regulations.

PPE falls under six general categories—gloves, gowns, shoe covers, face shields, caps, and
masks (surgical and N95). H+H utilizes a computer-based program called PeopleSoft to manage","manage
their medical surgical inventory, including ordering and end user distribution, as well as the
management of inventory records of medical surgical items.

The total medical surgical supply purchases for the five facilities for Fiscal Year 2021 totaled
$11,474,698.27.

Audit Findings and Conclusion

H+H has established several inventory rules and guidelines relating to the supply and
management of medical surgical supplies at its facilities. However, the agency does not ensure
that its facilities comply with those rules and guidelines.

Auditors visited all five facilities, conducting a PPE count at one (Carter) and observing a year-
end count at another (Coler). At both facilities, the auditors identified deficiencies which are
discussed in the body of this report. In its response, H+H noted that this audit was conducted

AUDIT REPORT

Background

H+H was established in 1969 under the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation Act as a
public benefit corporation and receives funding from the City tax levy. According to the Fiscal Year
2021 Mayor’s Management Report (MMR), H+H is the largest municipal health system in the
country, and it includes 11 acute care hospitals, five post-acute/long-term care facilities, and 70
patient care locations of community- and school-based health centers. H+H’s mission is to “deliver
high quality health care services to all New Yorkers with compassion, dignity, and respect,
regardless of income, gender identity, or immigration status.”

H+H’s five post-acute/long-term care facilities are Henry J. Carter, Coler, McKinney, Sea View,
and Gouverneur. The operation of these facilities is regulated and monitored by SDOH. Each of
the five facilities are, in part or in whole, licensed nursing homes and each is required to follow
related regulations. A licensed Administrator of Record (AOR) is ultimately responsible for
managing","managing each facility and ensuring compliance with SDOH regulations.”

PPE falls under six general categories—gloves, gowns, shoe covers, face shields, caps, and
masks (surgical and N95). Each category is comprised of multiple types of items, differentiated
based on factors such as size, material, etc. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SDOH
mandated that, as of July 22, 2020, each nursing home in New York State maintain at minimum
a 30-day supply of the following three categories of PPE—gloves, gowns, and masks—as part of
its stock inventory. In October 2020, this requirement was increased to a 60-day supply.

The Materials Management Director at each facility is responsible for managing the facility’s
inventory of medical surgical items including PPE. Each facility has a Central Store that is
responsible for ordering, storing, and distributing medical surgical items to the nursing units. The
Central Stores Manager is tasked with overseeing these functions. H+H’s Supply Chain Services
supports the facilities in contracting with vendors and purchasing medical surgical items. In
addition, its Regional Directors facilitate distribution of PPE to ensure optimum levels on inventory.
H+H utilizes PeopleSoft to manage their medical surgical inventory, including ordering and end
user distribution, as well as the management of perpetual inventory records of medical surgical
items.°

In three of the five facilities (Carter, McKinney, and Sea View), Central Stores staff inspect the
nursing units’ stock of medical and surgical items and determine replenishment quantities. In two
facilities (Coler and Gouverneur",8389,1135

In three of the five facilities (Carter, McKinney, and Sea View), Central Stores staff inspect the
nursing units’ stock of medical and surgical items and determine replenishment quantities. In two
facilities (Coler and Gouverneur) staff rely on the nursing units to submit requests for medical
surgical items.

To monitor the PPE usage and to ensure that facilities had enough PPE in stock, HtH mandated
weekly inventory counts of all PPE items, starting with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in
February 2020 through April 2021, after which H+H amended the requirement to bi-weekly counts.

through the use of computerized point-of-sale systems and enterprise asset management software.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

This is a follow-up audit to determine whether the New York City Health and Hospitals
Corporation (HHC) implemented the recommendations made in an earlier audit, Audit of the Health
and Hospitals Corporation’s Collection Practices and Procedures Related to Medicaid Managed
Care (MMC) / Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), issued October 6, 1997 (Audit No.
ME96-081A). The earlier audit determined the extent to which HHC collects payments from
HMOs for services provided by HHC to MMC patients. This follow-up report discusses the details
of the recommendations of the previous audit report and the status of each recommendation.

The previous audit made 22 recommendations to HHC. Of the 22 recommendations, 11
were implemented, three were partially implemented, one was not implemented, and seven were no
longer applicable. Those recommendations and their current implementation status are as follows:

1) HHC should ask the City, through the Mayor’s Office of Medicaid Managed Care, to
consider exercising the local option in the New York State Medicaid Managed","Managed Care plan,

whereby a locality can require Medicaid managed care providers to contract with local
public hospitals. NO LONGER APPLICABLE

HHC should regularly prepare a statistical report on emergency and clinic services
provided to MMC patients who are enrolled in plans that do not contract with HHC.
Using this information, HHC and other public health providers throughout the State
should define a statistical threshold for identifying plans that receive an excessive amount
of free services from local public hospitals or Health Department clinics. HHC can then
use the information in the regular reports to pressure HMOs to make payments for
legitimate HMO services. IMPLEMENTED

HHC, in conjunction with the City and with other local public hospitals or Health
Department clinics, should pursue passage of New York State legislation requiring that
Medicaid managed care plans reimburse them for legitimate, unreimbursed services

Through six regional health care networks, HHC operates 11 acute care hospitals; four long-

agency; and more than 100 community-based clinics.

The focus of this audit was HHC’s 11 acute care hospitals, which are located throughout the
city and provide outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room services. Many acute care hospital
patients are enrolled in Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) plans. For Medicaid recipients, these plans
coordinate, control, and pay for services. HHC hospitals bill the plans when members receive
hospital services. According to the HHC Cash Disbursements and Receipts Report for Fiscal Year
2001, HHC acute care hospitals reported receipts of approximately $111.5 million for inpatient and
outpatient MMC accounts.

INTRODUCTION

Background

The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) is a public benefit corporation
created by the New York State Legislature on July 1, 1970, to operate the City’s municipal hospital
system. Its mission is to provide comprehensive and quality medical, mental health, and substance
abuse treatment services equally to all New Yorkers, regardless of their ability to pay.

Through six regional health care networks, HHC operates 11 acute care hospitals; four long-
term care facilities; six comprehensive diagnostic and treatment centers; a certified home health
agency; and more than 100 community-based clinics.

The focus of this audit was HHC’s 11 acute care hospitals, which are located throughout the
city and provide outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room services. Many acute care hospital
patients are enrolled in Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) plans. For Medicaid recipients, these plans
coordinate, control, and pay for services. HHC hospitals bill the plans when members receive
hospital services. According to the HHC Cash Disbursements and Receipts Report for Fiscal Year
2001, HHC acute care hospitals reported receipts of approximately $111.5 million for inpatient and
outpatient MMC accounts.

The nationwide trend toward managed care plans and health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) has had an impact on HHC’s relationships with its patients. Given the emerging role of
managed","managed care plans, HHC established its own health maintenance organization, MetroPlus, to
compete with private HMOs for MMC patients. Currently, MetroPlus has contracts with all HHC
acute care facilities to provide comprehensive health care services to enrollees.

According to the HHC Fiscal Year 2001 Consolidated Financial Statements, it had operating
revenue of $4.29 billion and operating expenses of $4.31 billion. Table I shows the number of
patient discharges or visits, along with receipts reported for the 11 acute care hospitals.

In addition, we reviewed the following: standard operating procedures related to MMC
patients, the corporation’s consolidated financial statements for Fiscal Year 2001 and Fiscal Year
2000, the Cash Disbursements and Receipts Reports for Fiscal Year 2000 and 2001, the
Medicaid Managed Care Reports for calendar year 2001 for inpatient and outpatient services and
the Accounts Receivable Management Report for year ended December 31, 2001, and the MMC
contracts currently in effect in HHC’s hospitals.

We reviewed billing and collection practices for a sample of inpatient and outpatient
accounts at three randomly selected HHC acute hospitals: Bellevue Hospital, Kings County
Hospital, and Elmhurst Hospital. To obtain information on each hospital’s procedures, we
interviewed each hospital’s patient accounts director, ambulatory patient accounts director, as

RESULTS OF FOLLOW-UP AUDIT

Previous Finding: HHC received payment by HMOs for only 72 billable accounts (14.5%),
totaling $9,323, of the 514 billable accounts in the sample, totaling
$63,957. This low collection rate was due to certain weaknesses in the
HHC billing and collection system, as follows:

HHC does not have contracts with most managed care organizations. All 11 HHC hospitals
have contracts with MetroPlus, HHC’s wholly owned subsidiary. The only other HMO
contracts hospitals have are as follows: Coney Island Hospital had contracts with Cigna and
Oxford Health Plans, Harlem Hospital had contracts with CenterCare and Primecare, and
Bellevue Hospital had a contract with CenterCare. By entering into contracts with more
HMOs, HHC could increase its revenues by increasing its chances of getting paid for
services and obtaining the prepaid capitation’ amounts related to managed care patients.

HMOs did not pay HHC for legitimate services.

HHC never billed the HMOs for 85 (16.5%) of the sampled 514 services. In most cases,
HHC could not explain why the services were not billed.

HHC lacked detailed procedures on how hospital staff should bill and re-bill for HMO
services. In addition, the staff needed training on how to access basic billing and collection
information on the HHC computer system.

RESULTS OF FOLLOW-UP AUDIT

Previous Finding: HHC received payment by HMOs for only 72 billable accounts (14.5%),
totaling $9,323, of the 514 billable accounts in the sample, totaling
$63,957. This low collection rate was due to certain weaknesses in the
HHC billing and collection system, as follows:

HHC does not have contracts with most managed care organizations. All 11 HHC hospitals
have contracts with MetroPlus, HHC’s wholly owned subsidiary. The only other HMO
contracts hospitals have are as follows: Coney Island Hospital had contracts with Cigna and
Oxford Health Plans, Harlem Hospital had contracts with CenterCare and Primecare, and
Bellevue Hospital had a contract with CenterCare. By entering into contracts with more

Previous HHC Response: “The Corporation does not see any benefit to the creation of
a special task force to oversee the collection of one particular stream of revenue. The
Corporation’s priority is the overall fiscal health of the facilities it operates, with direct
responsibility for their performance belonging to the six Network Senior Vice Presidents.

Managed Care, and is held to those expectations.”

HHC officials created an Ambulatory Care Task Force, consisting of Senior Network
Vice Presidents and key Central Office and facility finance staff members, to closely examine
operational issues. In addition, collection problems and recommendations are discussed
periodically at Finance Committee Board meetings. HHC provided us with copies of Board
meeting minutes. There are also various oversight committees, such as a Managed Care
Oversight Committee and a Managed Care Policy Committee, to investigate collection problems
from HMOs.

We also obtained copies of inter-office memoranda and various reports issued by officials
of the Revenue Management Unit showing that they monitor receivables and disseminate

HHC still disagrees that dummy bills would be useful in determining whether bills are
actually being mailed. However, hospitals currently electronically bill some HMOs for services
provided to their members. This process facilitates the tracking of billed accounts. Furthermore,
although inpatient bills to other HMOs were mailed manually, verification of mailing was
possible since they were sent by certified mail. We feel that HHC’s procedures for inpatient
billing comply with the intent of the prior recommendation.

However, although some outpatient bills are electronically processed, it is still difficult to
track outpatient bills that are mailed manually to other HMOs, since the bills are not sent by
certified mail. According to hospital officials, HHC is still enhancing and testing its technology
to bill all HMOs electronically.

be more aggressive in pursuing collection efforts for payments due from MMC/HMOs.
These procedures should:

“Ensure that HMOs are billed within 30 days of the date of service.

“Ensure that HMOs that do not pay are billed again within 30 days of the first billing.
“Define collection efforts to be made in situations where HMOs do not pay after
receiving the first two bills from HHC.”

Previous Finding: Sixty-five percent of the total services in the sample were improperly

20

included in the MMC Accounts Receivable. Some of the services should
have been included in the strictly Medicaid Accounts Receivable. This
would have allowed HHC to bill and collect additional revenue owed from
Medicaid. Other services should have been written off, since they were
covered under capitation, which is not reimbursable.

HHC always billed and posted charges greater than the expected amount to be reimbursed by
HMOs.

HHC improperly included 472 services (out of a sample of 1,476 services) in its MMC

denial will be accepted. However, if either of these departments disagrees with the
plan’s findings, the denial is contested, using the plan’s appeal or dispute resolution
process.

HHC identifies HMOs that routinely and inappropriately deny payment and take
the necessary action against them, such as having their contracts terminated.

Recommendations:

HHC has implemented 11 recommendations and partially implemented three
recommendations the previous report made; seven are no longer applicable. Of the 22
recommendations the previous report made, one has not been implemented. To address the
problems noted in this report, HHC should implement the recommendations that were not fully
addressed. We believe that upon implementation of these recommendations, HHC will have
corrected the conditions cited in both the previous report and this follow-up report. The
recommendations are repeated below, somewhat revised according to the findings of this report.

Previous HHC Response: “The items enumerated in this recommendation are already
all incorporated in the Corporation’s Ambulatory/Emergency Care Operating Procedures
and policy.

“These policies are all currently being reviewed, will be updated and redistributed in the
Corporation’s Ambulatory Care Finance Policy Manual.

“The HHC Mission Statement/Mandate that we must provide medical care to MMC
patients who refuses to seek care from their designated HMO providers will not change.
We will work with those HMOs to educate their patients where choice rather than
emergent care is available and/or needed.”

Current Status: IMPLEMENTED

To determine whether the managed care companies are properly reimbursing HHC for
services provided to patients:

¢ Hospital staff members obtain valid authorization numbers for emergency room
visits and referral slips for specialty care clinics, and document their attempts in
SMS or patient account folders.

HHC has procedures in place to ensure that denials of payment from HMOs are
investigated. If an admission is denied or not fully paid based on lack of medical
necessity, any correspondence received from the HMO are forwarded to the
Utilization Review Department or Medical Records Department for their review.

If, upon review, Utilization Review or Medicaid","Medicaid Records agrees with the HMO, the
denial will be accepted. However, if either of these departments disagrees with the

To the Residents of the City of New York:

My office has audited the Health and Hospitals Corporation’s (HHC’s) affiliation agreement
with the Columbia University Medical Center (Columbia) to provide patient services in Harlem
Hospital. We audit contracts such as this to determine whether City agencies are effectively
monitoring contractors to ensure that funds allocated to the contracts are appropriately spent and
accounted for.

The audit found that Columbia did not comply with certain key financial and administrative
provisions of its affiliation agreement with HHC. Columbia did not submit required quarterly
fee","fee statements, annual recalculation reports, and other required documents. It also maintained
unreliable personnel rosters, assignment schedules, and timekeeping records. In addition,
Columbia lacked HHC-approved subcontract agreements with certain providers that rendered
services to Harlem Hospital patients on a per diem or temporary basis. Furthermore, the audit
found that HHC did not meet its responsibilities to closely monitor Columbia’s financial and
administrative practices.

This audit addresses nine recommendations to Columbia, including that Columbia should:
submit quarterly fee statements and annual recalculation reports to HHC on a timely basis;
submit subcontract agreements for HHC approval whenever a subcontractor is engaged to
provide services in Harlem Hospital; establish detailed timekeeping procedures; and maintain
accurate personnel rosters and assignment schedules. The audit also addresses 11
recommendations to HHC, including that HHC should: ensure that Columbia complies with the
financial provisions of the contract and conduct periodic reviews of the personnel rosters
prepared by Columbia.

The results of the audit have been discussed with Columbia and HHC officials, and their
comments have been considered in preparing this report. Their complete written response is
attached to this report.

If you have any questions concerning this report, please e-mail my audit bureau at

found that HHC did not meet its responsibilities to closely monitor Columbia’s financial and
administrative practices.

This audit addresses nine recommendations to Columbia, including that Columbia should:
submit quarterly fee statements and annual recalculation reports to HHC on a timely basis;
submit subcontract agreements for HHC approval whenever a subcontractor is engaged to
provide services in Harlem Hospital; establish detailed timekeeping procedures; and maintain
accurate personnel rosters and assignment schedules. The audit also addresses 11
recommendations to HHC, including that HHC should: ensure that Columbia complies with the
financial provisions of the contract and conduct periodic reviews of the personnel rosters
prepared by Columbia.

The results of the audit have been discussed with Columbia and HHC officials, and their
comments have been considered in preparing this report. Their complete written response is
attached to this report.

Audit Report on the Harlem Hospital
Affiliation Agreement with the
Columbia University Medical Center

ME10-067A

AUDIT REPORT IN BRIEF

This audit determined whether the Columbia University Medical Center (Columbia) is
complying with the terms of its affiliation contract with Harlem Hospital and whether the Health
and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) is adequately monitoring Columbia’s compliance. The
primary scope of the audit was Fiscal Year 2009 (July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009). We also
reviewed certain aspects of the affiliation agreement relating to Fiscal Years 2002 through 2008.

HHC serves City residents through its 11 acute care hospitals, 4 skilled nursing facilities,
6 diagnostic and treatment centers and",3820,423

primary scope of the audit was Fiscal Year 2009 (July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009). We also
reviewed certain aspects of the affiliation agreement relating to Fiscal Years 2002 through 2008.

HHC serves City residents through its 11 acute care hospitals, 4 skilled nursing facilities,
6 diagnostic and treatment centers and more than 80 community-based clinics. To help achieve
its goals, HHC contracts with affiliates, including medical schools, teaching hospitals, and
physician-owned professional corporations, which provide physician and supporting services to
patients in HHC facilities. One of these affiliation contracts was established by HHC with
Columbia to provide medical, mental health, and other services in Harlem Hospital and the
Renaissance Healthcare Network Diagnostic and Treatment Center. This report focuses on
services provided by Columbia to Harlem Hospital.

Harlem Hospital’s current affiliation agreement with Columbia is for three years. The
agreement began on July 1, 2007, and continues through June 30, 2010, with a total estimated
payment of $183,401,640.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

Our audit disclosed that Columbia is not complying with certain key financial and
administrative provisions of its affiliation contract with HHC to provide patient services to
Harlem Hospital. Although the affiliate has established a comprehensive accounting system and
generally submitted required external audit reports by the due date, there were significant areas
of noncompliance in terms of how the affiliate accounted for its use of HHC funds. Columbia
did not submit required quarterly fee","fee statements, annual recalculation reports, and other required
documents. It also maintained unreliable personnel rosters, assignment schedules, and
timekeeping records. Accordingly, HHC might not have received the full contractual benefit for
monies paid to Columbia. HHC and Columbia have not reconciled to actual expenses the

approximately $109 million in advance payments HHC made to Columbia for services provided
to Harlem Hospital during Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009. The lack of quarterly fee statements and
annual recalculation reports from Columbia for these two years made it impossible for us to
determine how much Columbia should be paid for the services it provided to Harlem Hospital
during this period. In addition, Columbia lacked HHC-approved subcontract agreements with
certain providers that rendered services to Harlem Hospital patients on a per diem or temporary
basis.

Our audit also disclosed that HHC did not meet its responsibilities to closely monitor the
affiliate’s financial and administrative practices. As a result, there is an increased risk that some
of the funds paid to Columbia were not used in compliance with contract terms.

Audit Recommendations

To address these issues, the audit recommends, among other things, that Columbia:

Submit quarterly fee statements and annual recalculation reports to HHC on a
timely basis.

Ensure that it submits contracts for HHC approval whenever a subcontractor is
engaged to provide services in Harlem Hospital.

relates to work performed for programs funded by external organizations. The OCR, which is
regularly updated by Columbia, establishes the opening budgeted compensation. HHC also pays
the affiliate for its employees’ fringe benefits, OTPS costs, and overhead expenses. Overhead is
based on two percent of salaries and fringe benefits.

Some of the physicians who are faculty members are part of the FPP. The affiliate is
permitted to collect payments from insurance companies for the direct patient care services
rendered by these physicians. HHC compensates the affiliate 81.18 percent for services rendered
by physicians who are part of the FPP arrangement, and the affiliate recoups the remaining 18.82
percent from the insurance companies. If the affiliate does not recover the anticipated 18.82
percent, it may request an adjustment from HHC.

To monitor the operations of the affiliate and ensure compliance with the agreement, the
contract requires the affiliate to prepare reports, also called annexes, as monitoring tools. Annex
A includes information on the affiliate’s clinical leadership, the roster of contract service
providers, and the providers’ credentials. Annex B establishes the initial annual budget. Annex
C provides post-graduate and other training information. Annex D includes financial
information related to the services rendered by the affiliate: Fee","Fee Statements (quarterly
expenditure reports on salaries, fringe benefits, OTPS, and overhead) and Recalculation reports
(reconciliations between annual expenditures and the semi-monthly payments received from
HHC, which are based on the budget amounts in Annex B). Annex E focuses on research and
grant activities, and Annex F is the Performance Indicators Report.

To serve the patients appropriately and to comply with the obligations of the agreement,
Columbia uses several computer systems: PeopleSoft database to process the payroll; the
Accounts Payable/Controlled Analytical Review (APCAR) system to process its OTPS
expenditures; and the Departmental Advanced Reporting and Tracking System (DARTS) for
reporting and tracking purposes. To monitor services provided by the affiliate and track patient
information, Harlem Hospital uses several computer systems: the Unity system to collect patient
information at the time of registration; the QuadraMed information management system to input
patient demographic and medical information; and the Performance Indicator Tracking System
(PITS) and the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) system to process
data for performance indicator reporting purposes.

performance and productivity.” According to HHC, the pay-for-performance model assesses
regulatory compliance, satisfaction of federal CMS indicators, and facility-specific quality and

Objective

The objective of the audit was to determine whether Columbia is complying with the
terms of its affiliation contract with Harlem Hospital and whether HHC is adequately monitoring
Columbia’s compliance.

Scope and Methodology

We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions
based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis
for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. This audit was conducted in
accordance with the audit responsibilities of the City Comptroller as set forth in Chapter 5, §93,
of the New York City Charter.

certificates of","requested all applicable policies and
procedures and information about the computer systems used in recording, processing, tracking,
and reporting information.

In addition, we reviewed the affiliation agreement between HHC and Columbia to
provide services to Harlem Hospital; monthly HHC President’s Reports to the Board of
Directors; Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS)
reports; the New York State Department of Health’s (NYSDOH’s) hospital profile; the Fiscal
Year 2009 Annex Package and Submission Schedule; external audit reports on and for the
affiliate; Dadia Valles Vendiola LLP’s (Dadia’s) audit reports on the affiliate that were prepared
for HHC; and relevant HHC, Harlem Hospital, and Columbia policies, procedures, and
regulations related to contract services. These documents were used to identify criteria and
requirements to assess Columbia’s compliance with contractual obligations.

To determine whether the affiliate complied with provisions of the contract related to the

preparation of monitoring documents, we requested all annexes for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009.
We reviewed these reports to determine whether they were prepared according to the contract.
To verify the appropriateness of payments made by HHC, we compared HHC’s semi-monthly
payments to the budgeted amounts in Annex B. We also reviewed the appropriateness of
settlements HHC reached with the affiliate for Fiscal Years 2002 through 2007.

To assess whether Columbia complied with its obligation to furnish all information
necessary to HHC, we requested the fidelity bond, external audit reports, FPP bank account
information, Fiscal Year 2008 and 2009 fee","fee statements and recalculations, assignment schedules,
certificates of effort, timesheets, and other required documents. To evaluate Columbia’s
compliance with the performance indicators, we interviewed Harlem Quality Assurance
personnel responsible for reporting on the extent to which Columbia met the performance
standards. In addition, to determine whether performance indicator reports conform to the
contract categories in the contract, we reviewed performance indicator reports on Columbia.

Furthermore, to determine whether Columbia paid providers for actual services and
whether the affiliate implemented adequate timekeeping practices, we selected the Radiology
Department for testing and compared provider assignment schedules, timesheets, certificates of
effort and payroll information for the month of July 2008. For the same department, we also
examined the appropriateness of payments to providers by comparing affiliate payroll reports for
the month of July 2008 to contract salaries on the roster. In addition, to ascertain whether the
affiliate’s staffing was consistent with its provider assignment schedules, we selected the
Pathology and Rehabilitation Departments for conducting unannounced floor checks on February

4, 2010. We also determined whether the departments were maintaining adequate timekeeping
and leave records.

To determine whether HHC was appropriately paying providers who might be on Harlem
Hospital’s payroll and also receiving payments under the affiliation contract, we conducted a
match between the affiliate payroll for the period of April through June 2009 and Harlem
Hospital payroll records for the same period to identify any providers who received payments

terms of its affiliation contract with HHC.

Discussion of Audit Results

The matters covered in this report were discussed with Columbia and HHC officials
during and at the conclusion of this audit. A preliminary draft report was sent to Columbia and
HHC officials on May 14, 2010, and was discussed at an exit conference held on June 3, 2010.
A draft report was sent to Columbia and HHC officials on June 11, 2010, with a request for
comments. We received a written response from HHC officials on June 25, 2010, which
included a written response from Columbia officials dated June 22, 2010.

The audit makes 9 recommendations to Columbia and 11 recommendations to HHC. In
their response, Columbia officials agreed with 5 recommendations, disagreed with 1, and stated
that it already complied with 3, while HHC officials agreed with 7 recommendations and stated
that it already complied with the remaining 4. In a few instances, the response clarified certain
information, and our report was modified accordingly. Unfortunately, in addition to presenting
some legitimate differences of opinion concerning our conclusions, the response includes
numerous misrepresentations of the findings presented in this report.

The fundamental finding in this report is that Columbia and HHC have not been
following the process mandated by the affiliation contract for reconciling expenditures and
payments on an annual basis. Instead of Columbia preparing quarterly fee","fee statements and annual
recalculation reports on a timely basis and HHC staff reviewing these expenditure reports
promptly, as envisioned by the contract, HHC has not required the submission of these
documents by Columbia and has resorted to lengthy multi-year settlements with Columbia by
use of an outside law firm. Had HHC been requiring Columbia to follow the contract and submit
timely expenditure reports, and had HHC been closely monitoring Columbia’s expenditures on
an ongoing basis, the agency could have achieved reconciliations with Columbia on an annual
basis, without having to use, at additional cost, an outside law firm and without having to resort
to multi-year settlements. The accuracy and reliability of annual expenditure information does
not improve with age, nor does it improve by being grouped with expenditure information from
one or more additional years as part of a multi-year settlement.

The primary scope of this audit was Fiscal Year 2009. HHC informed us in October
2009, soon after the audit began, that the reconciliations for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009 were not
complete. We repeatedly asked HHC for copies of the quarterly fee statements and annual

numerous misrepresentations of the findings presented in this report.

The fundamental finding in this report is that Columbia and HHC have not been
following the process mandated by the affiliation contract for reconciling expenditures and
payments on an annual basis. Instead of Columbia preparing quarterly fee statements and annual
recalculation reports on a timely basis and HHC staff reviewing these expenditure reports
promptly, as envisioned by the contract, HHC has not required the submission of these
documents by Columbia and has resorted to lengthy multi-year settlements with Columbia by
use of an outside law firm. Had HHC been requiring Columbia to follow the contract and submit
timely expenditure reports, and had HHC been closely monitoring Columbia’s expenditures on
an ongoing basis, the agency could have achieved reconciliations with Columbia on an annual
basis, without having to use, at additional cost, an outside law firm and without having to resort
to multi-year settlements. The accuracy and reliability of annual expenditure information does
not improve with age, nor does it improve by being grouped with expenditure information from
one or more additional years as part of a multi-year settlement.

The primary scope of this audit was Fiscal Year 2009. HHC informed us in October
2009, soon after the audit began, that the reconciliations for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009 were not
complete. We repeatedly asked HHC for copies of the quarterly fee","fee statements and annual

recalculation reports submitted by Columbia for these periods. HHC repeatedly refused to
provide these documents to us, stating that they were working documents that had not been
finalized and could therefore be misleading. What HHC has failed to understand, from the
beginning of the audit through its written response to the draft report, is that by not showing us
these working documents, we have no assurance that they have actually been submitted by
Columbia or, if they have been, that they are substantive and credible working documents. As a
result, we have no assurance that HHC and Columbia are proceeding in an appropriate manner to
reconcile Columbia’s expenditures and HHC’s payments.

Toward the end of audit fieldwork, we met with HHC’s outside law firm on the
procedures that were followed for the May 2009 settlement with Columbia for Fiscal Years 2006
and 2007. They explained the review that they did of payroll and other data to reconcile
expenditures and payments for these years. They also provided numerous spreadsheets to show
how they analyzed these data to arrive at the settlement amount for these years. Due to the fact
that the settlement agreement states that “any audits performed with respect to Fiscal Years 2006
and 2007 shall not be implemented to the extent that implementation would require any payment
by [HHC] ... or the recoupment or withholding by [HHC],” we decided not to do detailed",23996,3220

agreed-upon amounts paid to Columbia. As a result, we make no judgment on the accuracy or
validity of the analyses presented by HHC and Columbia in their responses with respect to those
years.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Our audit disclosed that Columbia is not complying with certain key financial and
administrative provisions of its affiliation contract with HHC to provide patient services to
Harlem Hospital. Although the affiliate has established a comprehensive accounting system and
generally submitted required external audit reports by the due date, there were significant areas
of noncompliance in terms of how the affiliate accounted for its use of HHC funds. Columbia
did not submit required quarterly fee","fee statements, annual recalculation reports, and other required
documents. It also maintained unreliable personnel rosters, assignment schedules, and
timekeeping records. Accordingly, HHC might not have received the full contractual benefit for
monies paid to Columbia. HHC and Columbia have not reconciled to actual expenses the
approximately $109 million in advance payments HHC made to Columbia for services provided
to Harlem Hospital during Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009. The lack of quarterly fee statements and
annual recalculation reports from Columbia for these two years made it impossible for us to
determine how much Columbia should be paid for the services it provided to Harlem Hospital
during this period. In addition, Columbia lacked HHC-approved subcontract agreements with
certain providers that rendered services to Harlem Hospital patients on a per diem or temporary
basis.

Our audit also disclosed that HHC did not meet its responsibilities to closely monitor the
affiliate’s financial and administrative practices. As a result, there is an increased risk that some
of the funds paid to Columbia were not used in compliance with contract terms.

days of the end of the quarter. The fee statement should show the providers’ compensation in
three categories: workload, non-workload, and service grants. Its purpose is to allow HHC to
track expenditures and to determine appropriate end-of-year payment amounts. The only
evidence we received that any fee statements were provided to Harlem Hospital was e-mails sent
by Columbia in October 2009—after our audit was initiated—in which the affiliate purportedly
transmitted fee statements for Fiscal Year 2008. Neither Columbia nor HHC provided any
evidence that fee statements for Fiscal Year 2009 had been submitted by Columbia. According to
a December 2009 e-mail, Harlem Hospital returned the Fiscal Year 2008 fee","fee statements,
apparently because the proper format was not used. The fee statements themselves, however,
were not included with the e-mails HHC provided nor were they ever given to us, although we

are unable to verify that the fee statements were ever provided.

In terms of the required recalculation reports, the agreement states that “for each Fiscal
Year, for each facility, the affiliate shall complete and submit the Corporation’s Recalculation
Document electronically, within a reasonable time after all necessary data is available.” It
further states that the recalculation report “reconciles the amount due and calculates a revised
payment for the next payment period by applying the appropriate contractual limitations
specified in the agreement.” However, during the audit, Columbia and HHC did not provide any
evidence that Columbia prepared any recalculation reports for Fiscal Years 2002 through 2009. !
Therefore, we must conclude that annual reconciliations were generally not performed to
reconcile advance payments and actual reimbursable expenditures incurred by the affiliate.

Noncompliance with Contract Provisions and Inadequate Contract Oversight

Failure to Submit Fee Statements and
Recalculation Reports

The contract requires that Columbia prepare and submit quarterly fee statements to HHC.
It also requires that annual recalculation reports be prepared. However, we repeatedly requested
those statements and reports for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009 but never received them. As a
result, we have no assurance that they were ever prepared, which is in violation of Columbia’s

Exhibit A-1. Importantly, the auditors were told in these meetings that the settlements
and the work preceding them exactly mimicked the reporting and recalculation processes
required by the Agreement.”

Auditor Comment: As noted under Discussion of Audit Results, we are concerned that
the reconciliation process was being primarily handled by an outside law firm rather than
by HHC staff, who should be actively monitoring the agreement and, therefore, more
familiar with Columbia’s performance of the contract. We also find it hard to believe
that the work of the outside firm, no matter how extensive, could duplicate the ongoing,
real-time monitoring and review of expenditures that HHC staff would have performed
over the multi-year periods covered by the settlements had Columbia submitted the
quarterly fee statements and annual recalculation reports as required. Further, based on
our discussions with the outside lawyer who oversaw the reconciliation analysis, it does
not appear that this analysis included a systematic review of source documentation (e.g.,
time records or work schedules) to ascertain that expenses were appropriately supported,
as we would expect HHC to have done as part of its monitoring of the agreement.

Obviously, a multi-year settlement process is a very tardy mechanism for reconciling
expenditures and payments. Not only is there no evidence that HHC took any effective action
during Fiscal Years 2004 through 2007 to compel Columbia to prepare and submit required fee
statements and recalculation reports, but HHC also explicitly waived the submission of fee","fee
statements and recalculation reports for those years in the two settlement agreements.

Had HHC closely monitored Columbia’s activities during these periods, it might have
avoided some of the large payout and waiver it agreed to in those settlements. HHC agreed to
pay $7.7 million* to Columbia in the January 2006 settlement and waived $5.4 million due from
Columbia in the May 2009 settlement. HHC’s decision to not require Columbia to fulfill its
contractual responsibilities allowed Columbia to receive payments throughout these periods
without providing timely accounts of its reimbursable expenditures. Unfortunately, this pattern
has continued for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009. Fee statements and recalculation reports for these
fiscal years were not available for our review because, according to HHC officials, they have not
completed their review of those documents. The only evidence that Columbia provided any of
those documents to HHC are the October 2009 and December 2009 e-mails mentioned above
that simply referred to the Fiscal Year 2008 fee statements. Even if these reports were in fact
submitted, they were submitted more than one year late and almost two months after our audit
was announced. HHC should have been requiring Columbia to submit fee statements and
recalculation reports in a timely manner so that HHC could have reconciled expenditures and
payments each year and avoided the use of multi-year settlements.

Auditor Comment: Had HHC’s approval process for hiring subcontractors to provide
patient services at Harlem Hospital been effective, numerous subcontractors would not
have been appointed to provide such services without HHC approval. HHC itself
acknowledges in its response that Columbia had a total of $17.5 million in non-
reimbursable costs relating to the use of unapproved staff in Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007.
HHC states that this was due to Columbia not following the prior approval requirements
of the agreement. However, we believe that had HHC closely monitored Columbia with
regard to its hiring actions, it would not have found that Columbia had hired unapproved
staff to such a large extent. Accordingly, we reaffirm our recommendation.

Noncompliance with the Subcontractor Provision of the Contract

Columbia lacked agreements with some subcontractors that provide services to Harlem
Hospital patients on a",40205,5725
Comptroller_Reports/ME10_067A.pdf,1,Medicaid,Medicaid reimbursement,53.333333333333336,lemma,"compliance, satisfaction of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS)
indicators, and facility-specific quality","a maximum of $1.5

million over the three years of the contract, or less than one percent of the total contract amount.
There was no evidence that any Fiscal Year 2008 or 2009 funds had been paid or withheld based
on the performance indicators. However, since the PI reports are to be the basis for calculating
performance-related bonuses and withholdings and for providing information on the quality of
patient services, it is essential that the reports be complete and accurate.

HHC Response: “The Pls required by the Affiliation contracts are a small subset of
those already reportable indicators. In addition, HHC monitors performance on quality
indicators by participating in nationally recognized quality assurance programs and by
reporting results to the quarterly Quality Assurance Committee of the HHC Board. The
completion of the performance indicator form and submission to OPSA is independent
and inconsequential to the thorough monitoring of quality indicator performance by State
and Federal accreditation and regulatory agencies.”

Auditor Comment: HHC’s minimizing of the significance of the performance-based
provisions of its affiliation agreement with Columbia stands in stark contrast to its July
26, 2007 report to its Board of Directors (which is available on its website) in which it
states that the new three-year agreement “will continue to compensate Columbia
University based on performance and productivity.” The report further states that “a pay-
for-performance model will be implemented to assess improvement in areas of regulatory
compliance, satisfaction of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid","Medicaid Services’ (CMS)
indicators, and facility-specific quality and efficiency indicators.” In addition, HHC
provided no supporting evidence of its quality assurance program efforts.

HHC Response: “At the exit conference on June 3, 2010 and provided in writing as a
follow-up, HHC discussed that 6 of the deficiencies (all but the 2 identified as “Medical
Staff’) reported on the NYSDOH website are attributable to Harlem Hospital actions and
not, in fact, ‘related to the medical care provided by the Affiliate.’ Therefore, they could
not properly be included in the PI report. Moreover, Columbia University could not
properly be charged any related withholds under the contract. The Affiliation Agreement
(Section 7) clearly states that ‘if the Affiliate fails to satisfy any Performance Indicator
due to factors under the Corporation’s control the Affiliate shall not be subject to the
withholds.” As discussed with the auditors, only the two citations numbered
405.4(a)(1)G), where the deficiency category is titled Medical Staff, are attributable solely
to Harlem Hospital’s Affiliate. This confirms the information both given to the auditors
by Harlem Hospital’s Quality Assurance Department and reflected on the Annex
F.” [Emphasis in original]

Auditor Comment: The performance indicator to which HHC is referring is identified on
the PI reports provided to us at the exit conference and in the affiliation agreement as one
pertaining to regulatory “citations re: patient care,” not just to citations relating to

percent of the total audit fees for each day that the report is","requires that HHC conduct annual audits of the affiliate’s operation.
However, these audits were either not conducted or were performed late. Consequently, HHC
did not meet its monitoring responsibilities in relation to this affiliation agreement.

According to the agreement, “The Corporation shall use its best efforts to conduct its
Final Audit within one year and three months from the date of its receipt of the Affiliate's Annual
Audit Report.”

While Columbia’s annual audit reports were generally issued on time, usually within six
months of the end of the fiscal year, HHC was lax in complying with its contract monitoring
responsibility. HHC provided external audit reports for Fiscal Years 2003 through 2007 from
the firm (Dadia) HHC hired to audit the affiliate’s operations. However, four of the five reports
were issued late. According to the affiliation agreement, the Fiscal Year 2003 report was issued

one week late, and the Fiscal Year 2004 report was issued five months late.

According to the HHC contract with Dadia, the Fiscal Year 2006 report was issued two
and one-half years late, and the Fiscal Year 2007 report was issued one year and seven months
late. The due date for the Fiscal Year 2008 audit report was July 31, 2009, and the due date for
the Fiscal Year 2009 audit report is July 31, 2010. The Fiscal Year 2008 audit report is overdue.

Moreover, the contract includes a provision that allows HHC to penalize Dadia two
percent of the total audit fees","fees for each day that the report is late. According to the contract
signed with Dadia, the maximum amount to be paid for the audit work is $362,615 for the Fiscal
Year 2006 audit report, $370,863 for the Fiscal Year 2007 audit report, and $379,111 for the
Fiscal Year 2008 report. HHC informed us on April 16, 2010 that it had paid Dadia $33,811 for
the audit reports for Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007. If the delay penalty had been imposed on
Dadia for these reports, no payments to Dadia would have been required.

Both the Fiscal Year 2006 and the Fiscal Year 2007 audit reports were issued on March
1, 2010. The Fiscal Year 2007 Management Letter was very similar to the one issued for Fiscal
Year 2006. For example, the only floor-check information provided in the two reports related to
floor checks conducted on March 15 and 29, 2007. Therefore, the floor-check information
provided in the Fiscal Year 2006 audit report related to audit steps conducted during Fiscal Year
2007.

As stated above, HHC reached a settlement with Columbia in May 2009 for Fiscal Years
2006 and 2007, so Dadia’s audit reports will have no impact on the reconciliations for those
years. In fact, the Fiscal Year 2006 report recommended that Harlem Hospital charge the
affiliate for all direct and indirect costs related to research protocols. Although Dadia’s audit

Office of New York","and
bonuses are calculated according to the contract, and implemented through the annual
reconciliation process; they are supported through inclusion of the PI reports and
associated calculations as back-up in the recalculation documents.”

Auditor Comment: As stated above, HHC did not provide final PI reports for Fiscal

Years 2008 and 2009 until the June 3, 2010 exit conference. No documentation was
provided to support the performance indicators presented in these reports. Absent any
evidence, we are unable to verify the accuracy of these reports.

18. Ensure that its contractor’s annual audits of the affiliate are completed on time.

HHC Response: “The Office of Internal Audits is working together with Dadia, OPSA,
Harlem Hospital and Columbia to ensure affiliation audits are completed within
timeframes established by both the Dadia, and the affiliation, agreements. Extensions
will continue to be granted only for additional audit procedures requested outside of the
contracted audit scope.”

19. Evaluate Dadia’s responsibility for the delays in issuing annual audit reports on the
affiliate and recover the appropriate amount from the payments already made.

HHC Response: HHC argued that it already performed this evaluation and stated: “The
delays for issuing final reports were due to HHC’s expansion of Dadia’s audit scope.
Supplemental audit procedures were implemented to ensure Affiliate compliance with
new operating procedures, and time and compensation requirements related to
grant/research protocols. Dadia performed these supplemental audit procedures at no
additional cost to HHC. As a result, assessment of a late penalty fee","fee was not warranted.”

Office of New York City Comptroller John C. Liu


## ME10_067A_page_31
Auditor Comment: The added audit steps described by HHC involved routine sampling
techniques and do not justify the one and one-half to two and one-half years of delays in
finalizing the Fiscal Year 2006 and 2007 audit reports according to the time frames
specified in HHC’s contract with Dadia.

Other Matter
Written Procedures

During the audit, HHC and Columbia provided very few written procedures on their key
efforts to ensure that contract provisions are met. As a best business practice, it is important that
an organization develop written procedures to help ensure that its key operations are
implemented efficiently, effectively, and consistently.

We requested copies of written procedures from the affiliate and relevant HHC and
Harlem Hospital units. During the audit, we received the Affiliation Contract Operational
Manual and Annex Instructions from HHC’s OPSA. However, despite repeated requests, we did
not receive written procedures from the affiliate, HHC’s Internal Audit unit, or Harlem
Hospital’s Finance or Quality Assurance units. HHC Central Finance furnished us a one-page
document prepared by KPMG, its external audit firm, for issuing payments to the affiliate.
However, the document did not cover the entire payment process and did not show that a proper
segregation of duties is in place for the payment approval process.

During the exit conference, we were provided with new procedures from the affiliate, the
HHC Central Finance unit, and the Harlem Hospital",87333,13115
Comptroller_Reports/ME10_067A.pdf,1,fee,Fee for Service,33.333333333333336,lemma,"staff consulted on the preparation of the fee statements and recalculation
documents over 40 times","and inaccurate. We
provided your auditors with many facts about the management of the contract, as well as
voluminous documentation of the meticulous reconciliation of payments to actual documented
expenses, yet the import of these facts and documentation are not fairly reflected in your draft
report. Our concerns were discussed with the principals in your Audit Department during the
June 3, 2010 exit conference.

Reading the draft report, one gets the mistaken impression that HHC may have failed to guard
public finds or adequately monitor Columbia University's reimbursable expenditures under the
contract. This is simply not the case. While the current audit of the Affiliation agreement found
discrepancies between the contract language and its implementation, there was no evidence of
the misuse of funds.

Although the auditors performed very limited testing, they nonetheless came to overly broad and
misleading conclusions. For example, the audit reports a lack of management oversight of the
Affiliation contract. The facts (and extensive documentation shared with the auditors) reveal
otherwise and the auditors’ conclusions to the contrary do not present a fair and balanced
assessment of the reality.

In fact, HHC’s Office of Professional Services and Affiliations (OPSA) conducted
approximately 1,000 substantive contract-related interactions with the personnel at Harlem
Hospital and/or Columbia University between 2002 and 2010. In FY 10 alone, OPSA and the
Harlem and Columbia staff consulted on the preparation of the fee","fee statements and recalculation
documents over 40 times. These interactions are all documented through contemporaneous log
entries, all of which were shared with your auditors. In addition, leadership at Harlem Hospital
meets regularly with Columbia University Affiliate leadership to discuss staffing and other issues
at monthly Joint Oversight Committee meetings. Furthermore, Harlem Hospital adheres to a
rigorous weekly Vacancy Review Board process in the vetting of Affiliate personnel actions.

Most significantly, the audit report demonstrates a fundamental mis-understanding about how
Affiliate compensation is determined and the role of the roster and provider workload in the
determination of payments. The audit report focuses on the technical obligation of the fee
statements and recalculations without acknowledging the complexity behind the accurate
preparation of these documents or the fact that contract compensation is set at only 95% of
documented costs at the outset of a contract period subject to later reconciliation to actual costs
throughout the contract term. The settlements arrived at in 2007 and again in 2009 were based
upon a review of extensive paper documentation, made available to the auditors, which tied
every penny of payment to work performed in the delivery of services to patients. The auditors
point to no deficiency in this documentation proffered that would suggest otherwise.

Other broad sweeping statements and conclusions are similarly not supported by the facts and the
documents. For example, the report asserts that there were “numerous discrepancies” in the
contract service provider rosters. In fact, as our attached detailed response explains, your",92530,13910

Dear Mr. Aviles:

Thank you for sharing a copy of the HHC response to the draft audit report and for allowing the
University the opportunity to respond as well. We share HHC’s concerns that the report is
misleading and appears premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the Affiliation
Agreement that governs the relationship between the University and HHC. The Audit Report
contains numerous errors and draws incorrect conclusions, the most disturbing of which is that
because of minor discrepancies between the Affiliation Agreement and its implemeniation, there
has been non-compliance by Columbia. As you know, that is simply not the case.

We were particularly dismayed that the audit alleges the University did not submit timely fee","fee
statements for FY '08 and FY ‘09. In fact CU has submitted those fee statements to the Facility
and has provided additional information (beyond what the Affiliation Agreement requires) as
requested by the Facility, In addition, FY ‘08 recalculation reports have been submitted; and, as
soon as that process is complete, the FY ‘09 recalculation reports will be submitted. The
ongoing review of all these work papers has been extensive, thorough, and interactive.

Also troubling was the assertion of deficiencies in the University’s time records, despite the fact
that the audit found only minor discrepancies in the Certificates of Effort and Timesheets, which
are used to document the performance of services by medical and non-medical providers under
the contract. Of particular note, the audit findings were based on a period prior to the
University’s issuance of new time-records policies and procedures. The audit report fails to note
this directive, despite our having shared these documents during the June 3, 2010 Exit
Conference.

Nor do we understand the assertion of unreliable rosters. To the contrary, the University
demonstrated that it maintains a detailed, up-to-date roster. On the auditor’s review, only a
single provider out of the almost 600 provider lines was not placed on the roster at the
appropriate time. The audit fails to note that this provider was, in fact, appropriately providing
services under the Affiliation and was added to the very next quarterly filing by the University
prior to audit roster testing",96958,14576

“increased risk that some of the funds” were not spent in compliance with the Agreement.
In fact, the audit identified absolutely no misuse of contract funds by Columbia. While
the auditors had substantial time and opportunity to identify any financial malfeasance —
they found none. .

Apart from the auditors’ unsupported speculation as to what “might have”
happened if the facts had been different, the audit report (1) fails to recognize the strong
protective mechanisms that HHC has put in place both prospectively in the establishment
of payment levels, and retrospectively in the conditions for reconciliation, to prevent any
possible misuse of funds; and (2) focuses on whether or not the Fee Statements and
Recalculation Documents were technically completed, without recognizing the on-going
exchange of documentation and the ongoing monitoring of Affiliate expenses that made
any settlement possible, In fact, the multi-year settlements which the auditors highlight
ultimately accomplished the identical year-by-year reconciliations that would have been
achieved by completion of the Fee Statements and Recalculation Documents. Any

For the FY 2008-2010 Agreement, HHC has required that Columbia provide the
verifiable documentation required by the Agreement in order to be reimbursed for
approved expenses. The auditors received copies of the emails in which Columbia
fulfilied its responsibility by submitting the required Fee Statements and the subsequent
revisions. The Fee Statements and the Recalculation Documents were clearly indicated
as attachments. Harlem Hospital has also fulfilled its responsibility by reviewing them
and requesting revisions. These documents require the input and verification of
thousands of cells. When all cells are correct and confirmed, the Recalculation

Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007

Shortly after execution ofthe FY 2002-2005 Settlement Agreement, negotiations
for a successor Affiliation Agreement were coritienced, in which Columbia argued for a

incorporated unapproved expeiditures that were not recognized in the FY 2002-2005

appropriate to the furnishing of services to patients. The parties agreed to work together
to analyze the roster and other expenses to determine whether an increase to Columbia
was justified.’

The parties began promptly to review all personnel actions over the course of FY
2004 through 2007. As necessary, we validated and corrected the roster to reflect the
line-by-line, action-by-action, “roll-forward” of all personnel actions. The rigorous
process by which HHC reviewed, validated and analyzed the approved and unapproved
changes in actual staffing and salaries that were for services at Harlem, as well as the
corresponding FY 2006 and FY 2007 expenditures, was described in detail to the
auditors; samples of the summary data and analyses submitted are attached to this
response (Exhibit A-1). The massive raw data files and underlying analytic spreadsheets
were shared with the auditors as well, and the exhaustive, layered process by which this
detailed accounting was performed was desctibed to, and acknowledged by, the auditors.

Statements and Recalculation Documents, the parties agreed that the Settlement could
officially substitute for the “Recalculation” review.

This Settlement process also was not “a very tardy mechanism for reconciling
expenditures and payments,” as the auditors allege. It was not some belated
retrospective; in fact, the process was initiated contemporaneously during FY 2007, and
involved examination of FY 2006 actions and expenses during the very same time frame
in which any Recalculation process would have commenced. Perhaps the auditors were
confused by the May 2009 execution date of the Settlement Agreement upon which the
review was based. The key financial determinations were long known by that point, and
execution was attenuated only by the intervening negotiations: for. the FY 2008-2010
Agreement, and the associated establishment of the new budget and payment level.

By focusing on the execution date of the Settlement, the auditors fail to recognize
that it was the result of on-going, timely and rigorous monitoring, review and analysis
through which HHC ensured that payments were properly reconciled to the correct
amount of compensation due. It is not true that HHC made a “decision to not require
Columbia to fulfill its contractual responsibilities.” In faét, HHC insisted on a more
rigorous documentation and accounting requirement, which was detailed in both
discussion and supporting documentation on numerous dceasions to the auditors.

Settlement Amounts

The audit states “Had HHC closely monitored Columbia’s activities durmg these
periods, it might have avoided",115972,17498
Comptroller_Reports/ME10_067A.pdf,1,Medicaid,Medicaid reimbursement,53.333333333333336,lemma,"to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) through their
Quality Improvement Organization","inconsequential for two reasons. First,
the Annex F form is not the primaty method that HHC uses to monitor quality of care.
Second, drafts are reviewed until correct and any financial incentives or disincentives
associated with the Annex F are determined and paid out or withheld only after the
finalization of the Recalculation Documents for FYs 2008 and 2009.

The report’s assertion that the Performance Indicator reports provide information
on the quality of patient services (QA) misses the actuality that HHC accomplishes the
monitoring of QA through important external regulatory reporting requirements which
are fulfilled. HHC regularly monitors performance indicators in compliance with State
and Federal accreditation and regulatory reporting requirements. The PIs required by the
Affiliation contracts are a small subset of those already reportable indicators. In addition,
HHC monitors performance on quality indicators by participating in nationally
recognized quality assurance programs and by reporting results to the quarterly Quality
Assurance Committee of the HHC Board. The completion of the performance indicator
form and submission to OPSA is independent and inconsequential to the thorough

84455767_8 11

ADDENDUM
Page 16 of 47


## ME10_067A_page_48
monitoring of quality indicator performance by State and Federal accreditation and
regulatory agencies.

As required by Federal regulations, HHC reports mandated quality improvement
data on a monthly basis for all patients hospitalized with diagnoses of pneumonia, acute
myocardial-infarction, heart failure, and patients having surgery who are given
prophylaxis for infection prevention. HHC submits these quality performance data
directly to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid","Medicaid Services (CMS) through their
Quality Improvement Organization (QIO).

The designated QIO works directly with hospitals assigried to it by CMS, and
automatically reports back to each HHC facility, including Harlem Hospital, any
indicator whose measurement is below the threshold. Once Harlem Hospital receives
information that an indicator has measured below the threshold, this information is given
to the appropriate Chief of Service for corrective action. When necessary, a performance
improvement project is initiated, reported to the facility’s compliance meeting and to the
Quality Assurance Committee of the HHC Beard. Harlem Hospital implements the
performance improvement project, monitors compliance ‘and submits data to CMS
through the QIO.

The audit report also asserts that there is no assurance that HHC monitors
Columbia’s performance in relation to fie required perfvxmance indicators. They
describe how they were “unable to determihe which report contained the accurate
indicator amounts.” The latest drafts that they received are final. The report is correct
that the PI reports are :tlie basis for calpulating performance related bonuses and
withholds. As shared with the auditors, the bonuses and withholds for compliance with
the contractually required Pis:-.are evaluated as part of the recalculation process.
Payments for. earning bonuses .or deductions for withholds are adjustments to
compensation due in the Reealculation Documents (Agreement, Attachment B, §$IV.A,
last paragraph). Bonuses and-withholds for FY 2008 will be accounted for in the FY
2008 Recalculation Documents and bonuses and withholds for FY 2009 will be

« Ensure that all grant/research projects had received the appropriate HHC

These added tasks required further investigation, supplementary resources and

ancillary analyses in order to provide an accurate accounting to HHC. Therefore, HHC
was acting responsibly in allowing Dadia’s deadlines to be extended.

We acknowledge that delays in the submission of finalized audit reports by Dadia
has continued with respect to FY 2008 and we are working with Dadia, Harlem Hospital
_ and Columbia University to resolve this issue. However, we disagree fully and generally
with the audit's conclusion that HHC “did not meet its monitoring responsibilities in
relation to this affiliation agreement"" with respect to conducting audits. The audit
ignores the fact that HHC does not wait until the final draft report is issued to review
Dadia’s findings. HHC has regular on-going discussions during field work with staff
from Harlem Hospital and Columbia University regarding problematic issues uncovered:
by Dadia. Further, HHC collaborates with Columbia University to resolve all issues.

The auditors’ discussion about late fees","fees under the Dadia contract is a matter of
internal HHC enforcement of its agreement with Dadia and, as.sich, is outside the scope
of this audit and unrelated to HHC’s monitoring of the Affiliation Agreement. Moreover,
the audit's conclusion that ""[i]f the delay penalty had been imposed on Dadia for these
reports, no payments to Dadia would have been required” is wrong. The audit also
ignores the fact that HHC extended the deadline for these reports when it expanded the
scope of the audit. Further, Dadia waived amounts-due for the additional hours required
as a result of the scope expansion. Accordingly, HHC properly paid for the audit services
furnished by Dadia.

The audit report also states that “HEIC reached a settlement with Columbia in
May 2009 for Fiscal Years 2006 and 2067, so Dailia’s audit reports will have no impact
on the reconciliations for those years.” To the-contrary, the Settlement Agreement does
not waive the audit requirement, preserves fhe impact of the audits in certain financial
respects, and allows for the implementation of a wide range of the recommendations cited
in the Fiscal Year 2006 and 2007: audits.

Few Written Precedures

‘Finally, the report concluded that Harlem Hospital’s Finance unit procedures for
reviewing the provider resters and iandling the payment reconciliations are limited. As
' was descrited to the auditors on several occasions, the procedures defined in the
Affiliation Contract Manual are comprehensive, clearly laying out the responsibilities of
each unit, including the process",145370,22079

Failure to submit Fee Statements and Recalculation Reports

As explained in","workload (so-called
“workload departments). These semi-monthly payments are based on 95 % of an agreed-upon Opening
Contract Roster (OCR), with annual reconciliations and recatculations. Thus, in a hypothetical year, the
University will have incurred 100 % of the cost of providing these services but HHC will have paid the
University only 95 % of the monies actually owed based on that OCR. The balance is not paid to
Columbia until there has been a reconciliation and recalculation. That thorough process ensures that the
net amount paid to the University is the amount actually owed for the services performed. Indeed, when
patient care needs compel! the University to hire additional staff, the Hospital receives the immediate
benefit of the services performed by those professionals. However, the University has to wait until the
reconciliation is completed to obtain reimbursement for these expenditures.


## ME10_067A_page_53

As required by the contract, the recalculation for any given fiscal year cannot be completed until the prior
year is closed and the parties are in agreement on the additional amounts that are due and owing.
Currently, the parties are in the process of completing the recalculations for FY08 and FY09. That means
that Columbia University has only been paid based on its FY08 OCR and will not be reimbursed for the
salaries of approved additions to that roster or for salary increases negotiated with the labor unions

S ent ment

The Settlement process, as outlined in HHC’s Attachment A, required HHC and CUAH to perform a full
reconciliation of ali costs prior to the closing (or the settling) of a fiscal year. The reconciliation for FY 06
and FY 07 was a lengthy joint process between HHC and CUAH.

CUAH confirms that the $17.5 million referenced in the audit report for FY06 and FY0? represented the
amount spent in support of services at Harlem Hospital in excess of the amount reimbursed. It is incorrect
to conclude that funds paid to CUAH were a result of non-compliance with the contract.

In order to institute a more formal process of review, in the fall of 2007, CUMC and HHC developed and
implemented",154591,23507

in the recalculation process, at which time appropriate payment levels are determined, Unfortunately, the
audit report reviewed July 2008 documents, prior to the issuance of this time record directive.

As CUAH and HHC discussed during the Exit Conference, the relevant time-keeping document for
medical providers under the Affiliation Agreement is the Certificate of Effort, which is completed weekly
and approved by the chief of service. For non-physicians, current policy requires timesheets (with sign
in/out signatures) that are completed daily and approved by either the supervisor or the department head.

The report found discrepancies in signatures on these earlier (prior to the May 2009 policy) timesheets.
CUAH demonstrated to the auditors that 8 out of 9 timesheets were indeed signed by either the supervisor
or the department head. As we advised the auditors at the June 3, 2010 Exit Conference, both signatures
are not required.

Upon our inspection of provider signatures, we could not conclusively agree with the visual findings of
the auditor that certain of these were “questionable”.

Departments may, of course, supplement these required time records with their own monitoring systems,

As for the speculation that HHC might pay for employees who were not present, there is no basis for this
conclusion. As HHC and CUAH explained during the course of the audit and at the exit conference, the
5% hold back provides ample protection. If during the annual recalculation a problem is noted with
attendance records, CUAH will not be compensated unless it can be determined from alternate sources
that the CUAH employee was present and providing services.

Unreliable Rosters
Contrary to the assertion of the audit report, CUAH maintains a detailed, up-to-date roster.

The audit report states there were thirty-four (34) errors in the rosters that were compared. In fact, there
was only one, which was subsequently self-corrected by CUAH. Thirty-three of the 34 questioned

There is no question that the provider was, in fact, properly providing services under the Affiliation
Agreement, Moreover, CUAH self-reported this discrepancy during the preparation of the A-2 (Q1 FY10)
and the roster was corrected and updated, as noted in the documents provided at the June 3 exit
conference. We have provided a line-to-line comparison of the two rosters and have identified the
corresponding lines on the rosters for thirty-four providers. Ali vacant positions were appropriately
identified on the roster with a termination date.

No Fidelity Bond Certificate Available

HAC does not require that CUAH maintain separate bond coverage.

The University maintains a Crime Insurance policy, at its own expense, which is more than sufficient to
meet contract requirements. As a result, HHC waived the requirement that CUAH maintain separate
bond coverage.

The University’s Crime Insurance Policy was examined by the NYC Comptroller’s auditor on Tuesday,
June 1, 2010, without objection. As HHC’s outside counsel! explained during the June 3, 2010 Exit
Conference, HHC waived the requirement of the bond so as to avoid an unnecessary expense to the
Corporation.

AUDIT REPORT IN BRIEF

The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) provides City residents
with comprehensive medical and mental health services, as well as treatment for substance
abuse, regardless of ability to pay. HHC hospitals, clinics, and other facilities require substantial
quantities of drugs and medical and surgical supplies, and must ensure that items are in stock
when needed. Each facility stores its perpetual inventory records in the HHC",1575,245
Comptroller_Reports/MG03_059A.pdf,1,William,William Brown,70.0,lemma,"Office of the New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_059A_page_5
noncontrolled drugs and","quantities of drugs and medical and surgical supplies, and must ensure that items are in stock
when needed. Each facility stores its perpetual inventory records in the HHC computerized
OTPS (Other Than Personal Services) procurement management system. During Fiscal Year
2002, Kings County Health Center (Kings County Hospital), the facility covered by this audit,
spent approximately $13 million for drugs (controlled and noncontrolled) and $6 million for
medical and surgical supplies. Our audit objective was to review the internal controls over Kings
County Hospital’s inventory of noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

Kings County Hospital has inadequate controls over its inventory of noncontrolled drugs
and medical and surgical supplies. Our review of its inventory practices disclosed significant
weaknesses in its issuing, recording, security, and maintenance of both inventories. Kings
County Hospital failed to institute and enforce the controls necessary to ensure the proper
safeguarding and accounting of its inventories.

Our inventory count of sampled noncontrolled drugs revealed a gross discrepancy of 71
percent between the amounts on hand and the amounts recorded in OTPS. Our inventory count
of sampled medical and surgical supplies revealed a gross discrepancy of 91 percent between the
amounts on hand and the amounts recorded in OTPS. Furthermore, approximately four months
prior to our inventory count, the Kings County Hospital officials made adjustments of $6.1
million and $2.5 million, respectively, to its Fiscal Year 2002 year-end inventory count of

1 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_059A_page_5
noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies, without investigating the cause of the
discrepancies.

These inventory discrepancies may result from the extensive record-keeping and security
weaknesses that we found. Because of those weaknesses, Kings County Hospital inventory
records for noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies cannot be relied on to ensure
that adequate stock levels are maintained and that loss from thefts and misappropriation would
be detected.

We also found that there was unrestricted access to the Pharmacy stockroom,
noncontrolled drugs were issued from the stockroom without proper authorization, and there
were inadequate controls over the expired drugs as well as inadequacies in the related checks and
credits that can be received for returnable expired drugs. In addition, we found that Materials
Management took up to two months to record in OTPS the issuances of medical and surgical
supplies from the stockroom. Besides the delay in entering information, we found that there were
many discrepancies between the data in the OTPS system and in the Scan Module system—the
computer system used to determine the medical and surgical supplies needed in the supply rooms
in the patient units. In many cases, the two systems had different catalog numbers for the same
item.

Audit Recommendations

The report makes 20 recommendations, some of which are listed below. Kings County
Hospital officials should:

Require periodic physical counts of the inventory to verify the accuracy of its
inventory records, and investigate all variances to determine their cause.

Require periodic physical counts of the inventory to verify the accuracy of its
inventory records, and investigate all variances to determine their cause.

Ensure that appropriate adjustments are made to the OTPS system to accurately
reflect the inventory of noncontrolled drugs and of medical and surgical supplies.
Officials should review, approve, and document all adjustments.

Ensure that a written authorized requisition is obtained for all noncontrolled drugs
issued from the Pharmacy stockroom. The requisition should include the names and
quantities of drugs requested, the names of subdivision personnel requesting the drug,
and the authorizing signature.

Restrict access to the Pharmacy stockroom to authorized stockroom personnel.

Adequately safeguard expired drugs before they are removed from the hospital.

Ensure that all checks and credits for returnable drugs are received by the hospital
and, if applicable, applied to vendor payments.

Ensure that all issues from the Materials Management stockroom are immediately
entered in the OTPS inventory system.

e Ensure that the Scan Module system has up-to-date catalog numbers for medical and
surgical supplies and that those numbers are identical to the catalog numbers in
OTPS.

HHC Response

The matters covered in this report were discussed with Kings County Hospital officials
during and at the conclusion of this audit. A preliminary draft report was sent to HHC officials
on May 28, 2003 and was discussed at an exit conference on June 11, 2003. We submitted a draft
report to HHC officials with a request for comments on June 12, 2003, with a request for
comments. We received a written response from HHC officials on June 25, 2003.

HHC officials agreed with the findings and either have implemented or are in the process
of implementing all 20 recommendations. However, they disagreed with the auditors’
representation of the inventory discrepancies in the aggregate, in which inventory overages and
shortages are combined. They stated, “This is neither fair nor appropriate and can be misleading.
Overages and shortages should be netted against each other or presented separately, to properly
reflect the value of inventory variances.”

Auditor Comment

This report fairly and accurately presents the discrepancies found in the inventories of
noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies in Kings County Hospital. The combined
discrepancies represent the total (absolute) value of the inaccuracies in the inventories. When
ensuring the accuracy of inventory, each unjustified shortage and overage is considered a
discrepancy. To present a complete picture of",7486,1107

INTRODUCTION

Background

The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) provides City residents
with comprehensive medical and mental health services, as well as treatment for substance
abuse, regardless of ability to pay. Within its seven regional health care networks, HHC operates
11 acute-care hospitals; four long-term care facilities; six diagnostic and treatment centers; one
certified home health agency; and a large number of community-based primary care, dental, and
child health clinics.

HHC hospitals, clinics, and other facilities require substantial quantities of drugs and
medical and surgical supplies, and must ensure that items are in stock when needed. HHC has a
computerized OTPS (Other Than Personal Services) procurement management system that stores
perpetual inventory records. To maintain and update its records as necessary, each facility has
access to the system, and the system, based on minimum and maximum quantities, includes a
reorder point for each item at each facility.’ The OTPS system can generate a purchase
requisition when the reorder point is reached. The requisitions can be printed out at each
facility’s Pharmacy Department or Materials Management Department—the entities that order
and maintain inventories of drugs and medical and surgical supplies. HHC requires that each
facility perform a physical inventory at the end of each fiscal year.

Kings County Health Center (Kings County Hospital), the facility covered by this audit,
is part of the HHC Central Brooklyn","Brooklyn Family Health Network (Network). At Kings County
Hospital, the Assistant Director of the Pharmacy stockroom purchases the drugs needed by the
Pharmacy stockroom and various Pharmacy subdivisions. To order medical and surgical
supplies, the Coordinating Manager of the Central Stores sends requisitions of items needed to
the hospital Purchasing Department. That department enters the data in the OTPS system, and
purchase orders are printed. The Associate Director of the Purchasing Department reviews and
approves the purchase orders.

Drugs are categorized into two groups: controlled and noncontrolled. Controlled drugs
are regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), a federal law-enforcement agency
that has strict requirements for storage, record keeping, and dispensing of controlled drugs. The
DEA, however, does not regulate noncontrolled drugs. This audit reviews the inventory controls
put in place by HHC and Kings County Hospital over noncontrolled drugs and medical and
surgical supplies.

During Fiscal Year 2002, the total cost of drugs (controlled and roncontrolled) purchased
by the Pharmacy Department was approximately $13 million. The total for medical and surgical
supplies purchased by the Materials Management Department (Materials Management) was
about $6 million. The value of the inventory of all drugs in the Pharmacy Department stockroom
at the end of Fiscal Year 2002 was $538,776, and the value of the medical and surgical supplies
in the Materials Management stockrooms was $1,103,300.

All shipments to Kings County Hospital are delivered to the hospital receiving dock.
When shipments for the Pharmacy are unloaded, the delivery person and one or more Pharmacy
stockroom employees takes the delivery to the stockroom. The Pharmacy personnel check each
shipment for accuracy and then enter the items in the OTPS system. For medical and surgical
shipments, hospital receiving personnel check the shipments for accuracy and enter the items in
the OTPS system.

The Pharmacy stockroom receives requests for noncontrolled drugs from the 10
subdivisions of the Pharmacy Department. The names and functions of these subdivisions are
listed in Appendix I of this report.

Materials Management stores medical and surgical supplies (i.e., intravenous solutions,
syringes, needles, bed liners, and tubing) in three stockrooms. Each unit of the hospital has one
or more supply rooms where medical and surgical supplies are stored in bar-coded bins. Each
day the stockroom staff inspects the inventory levels in assigned supply rooms. They use scan-
guns to scan bar codes of the empty bin compartments. The scan-guns register the maximum
capacity of each bin compartment that must be replenished.

Objective

Our audit objective was to review the internal controls over Kings County Hospital’s
inventory of noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies.

Scope and Methodology

The scope of this audit was Fiscal Year 2003. To achieve our audit objectives, we
reviewed the following HHC documents and procedures: Inventory Verification for Fiscal Year

Scope and Methodology

The scope of this audit was Fiscal Year 2003. To achieve our audit objectives, we
reviewed the following HHC documents and procedures: Inventory Verification for Fiscal Year
2002 and the inventory procedure manual; Operating Procedure No. 140-2, Repackaging of
Drugs, Proper Labeling and Maintaining of Appropriate Records; Operating Procedure No. 140-
1, Requisitioning Drugs and Pharmaceuticals; Operating Procedure No. 140-6, Requisitioning of
Drugs and Pharmaceuticals for Ward, Clinic, Emergency Room and All Other Medication
Areas; Operating Procedure No. 110-24, Unauthorized Procurements;, Operating Procedure No.
110-1, Procurement of Supplies, Services and Equipment; and the Automated Materials
Management Inventory System Manual. We also reviewed the contract between HHC and
Guaranteed Returns, Inc., for the services associated with disposing of expired drugs and
obtaining credit, where applicable. We interviewed hospital officials, including the Associate
Executive Director of Materials Management and Receiving and the Director of the Pharmacy.

To familiarize ourselves with the operations at the Pharmacy Department, we performed
a walk-through of all areas of the Pharmacy with the Pharmacy Director and three Associate
Directors, and obtained additional information about the Pharmacy’s operations at each
Pharmacy subdivision. We also interviewed the personnel of several Pharmacy subdivisions.

Accompanied by the Assistant Executive Director of Materials Management and
Receiving Department and the Coordinating Managers of Receiving and Central Stores, we

performed a walk-through of the intake and distribution system for medical and surgical
supplies—from the receiving dock, to the storerooms, to the supply rooms on the hospital floors.
We traced the flow of medical and surgical supplies from the time shipments arrive at the
receiving dock until the items reach the hospital floors.

We reviewed the policies and procedures issued by the Pharmacy Department covering
the following subjects: drug purchasing and maintenance of adequate inventory levels; receiving
medication from vendor, storing it in the stockroom, and issuing it to the various subdivisions of
the Pharmacy; re-packing of medication; administration of medication to in-patients and out-
patients; disposition of unused and expired drugs; and the annual count of the inventory in the
Pharmacy stockroom.

We also reviewed the policies and procedures of the Materials Management Department
that govern the following operations: acquisition of supplies, equipment, and services; receiving
of supplies and recording the receipts; storing and maintenance of the inventory in storerooms;
Scan Module System operations; issuing intravenous (I.V.) solutions to nursing units; and
supplying and maintenance of the storage areas on the patients’ units.

To determine whether the above policies and procedures were actually followed, we
performed observations at each area operated by the Pharmacy Department and Materials
Management.

We observed, at each Pharmacy subdivision, the loading of carts and patient cassettes,
and the receipt and storage of noncontrolled drugs ordered from the stockroom. We also
accompanied Materials Management personnel when",15716,2346

necessary. It was","ordered from the stockroom. We also
accompanied Materials Management personnel when they inspected the inventory levels of
supplies in the supply rooms, then assembled and delivered the supplies.

To assess the hospital’s internal controls, we prepared detailed flow charts of the
movement of noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical items. We observed how the
shipments arrived at the receiving dock, reviewed the logbook entries, and traced each shipment
to its final destination by comparing the entries in the receiving logbook with the delivery
receipts signed by the end-users.

To determine whether accurate inventory records are maintained, we performed a
physical inventory count of noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies. We
randomly selected our sample from the OTPS perpetual inventory records, which we obtained
from HHC in hard-copy form and on diskette. We adjusted the OTPS recorded inventory
balances to reflect the issuances and receipts that were not yet recorded at the time of our
inventory count. For the noncontrolled drugs inventory, we randomly selected 283 items from a
population of 1,321. We then compared the inventory count results to the adjusted recorded
balances. For the medical and surgical supplies inventory, we randomly selected 270 items from
a population of 1,218. We then compared our inventory count results with the adjusted, recorded
balances.

This audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards (GAGAS) and included tests of the records and other auditing procedures considered

as set forth in Chapter 5, § 93, of the New York City Charter.

Discussion of Audit Results

The matters covered in this report were discussed with Kings County Hospital officials
during and at the conclusion of this audit. A preliminary draft report was sent to HHC officials
on May 28, 2003 and was discussed at an exit conference on June 11, 2003. We submitted a draft
report to HHC officials with a request for comments on June 12, 2003, with a request for
comments. We received a written response from HHC officials on June 25, 2003.

HHC officials agreed with the findings and either have implemented or are in the process
of implementing all 20 recommendations. However, they disagreed with the auditors’
representation of the inventory discrepancies in the aggregate, in which inventory overages and
shortages are combined. They stated, “This is neither fair nor appropriate and can be misleading.
Overages and shortages should be netted against each other or presented separately, to properly
reflect the value of inventory variances.”

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Kings County Hospital has inadequate controls over its inventory of noncontrolled drugs
and medical and surgical supplies. Our review of its inventory practices disclosed significant
weaknesses in its issuing, recording, security, and maintenance of both inventories. Kings
County Hospital failed to institute and enforce the controls necessary to ensure the proper
safeguarding and accounting of its inventories.

We found the following discrepancies and areas of concern:

Our count of sampled noncontrolled drugs revealed a gross discrepancy of 71 percent
between the amounts on hand and the amounts recorded in OTPS.

Our count of sampled medical and surgical supplies revealed a gross discrepancy of
91 percent between the amounts on hand and the amounts recorded in OTPS.

Without investigating the cause of the discrepancies, the Kings County Hospital
officials made adjustments of $6.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively, to its Fiscal
Year 2002 year-end inventory count of noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical
supplies.

Access to the Pharmacy stockroom was unrestricted.

Controls over expired drugs were inadequate.

These discrepancies may result from the extensive record-keeping and_ security
weaknesses we found. Because of those weaknesses, Kings County Hospital inventory records
for noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies cannot be relied on to ensure that
adequate stock levels are maintained and loss from thefts and misappropriation would go
undetected. During Fiscal Year 2002, the total cost of drugs (controlled and noncontrolled)
purchased was approximately $13 million and the total cost of",20885,3133

undetected. During Fiscal Year 2002, the total cost of drugs (controlled and noncontrolled)
purchased was approximately $13 million and the total cost of medical and surgical supplies
purchased was about $6 million.

Inaccurate Inventory Records at the Pharmacy Stockroom

We conducted a physical inventory count on October 17 and 18, 2002, of a random
sample of 283 noncontrolled drugs of the 1,321 listed in the population and compared our results
to the balances recorded in OTPS on the morning of October 17, 2002.7 For 200 (70.67%) of the
283 items, the inventory count differed from the OTPS recorded inventory: for 116 items, there
was less in the inventory (valued at $92,445) than was recorded, and for 84 items, there was
more in the inventory (valued at $135,953) than was recorded. We are therefore 95 percent
confident (+ or - 4.7%) that there were discrepancies (both shortages and overages) in the
inventory records for 934 of the 1,321 items in the population of noncontrolled drugs (542
shortages and 392 overages). We also estimated that the dollar value of the discrepancies was
$1,533,861, ($622,125 in shortages and $911,736 in overages), as shown in Table I, below.

We provided the Director of the Pharmacy Department with a list of all the discrepancies.
We received no explanations or comments from the Director that would account for any of the
differences.

Approximately four months prior to our inventory count, Pharmacy officials conducted
their Fiscal Year 2002 year-end inventory count. Our review disclosed that substantial
adjustments were made to the inventory balances recorded in OTPS. Of 1,392 controlled and
noncontrolled drugs listed in OTPS, adjustments were made to 891 drugs (64%), valued at
$6,141,380: 497 adjustments, totaling $4,675,433, were made to lower the recorded quantity and
value of drugs; and 394 adjustments totaling $1,465,947 were made to increase the recorded
quantity and value of drugs.

The Assistant Director of the Pharmacy stockroom stated that the adjustments were made
to inventory balances recorded in OTPS to match the physical year-end balance in the inventory
count.

The error rate we found during our inventory count and the large fiscal year-end
adjustments made by Kings County Hospital Pharmacy officials are indications that the internal
controls over noncontrolled drugs are inadequate and a perpetual inventory system is not being
maintained. Furthermore, Pharmacy officials did not investigate the discrepancies. Making
adjustments to inventory records without proper investigation and adequate justification removes
a key control to safeguarding assets. Also, adjusting the inventory balances at fiscal year end
makes loss due to theft and misappropriation more difficult to detect.

makes loss due to theft and misappropriation more difficult to detect.

Internal Control Weaknesses over Noncontrolled Drugs

During our observations in the Pharmacy stockroom we found inadequate controls over
the issuance and receipt of noncontrolled drugs. Noncontrolled drugs were issued from the
Pharmacy stockroom to its subdivisions and directly to patient units without requiring authorized
written requisitions; and issuances of noncontrolled drugs were inaccurately recorded, if
recorded at all. The Pharmacy stockroom ordered and received noncontrolled drugs from
vendors before it prepared the purchase orders; and receipt of noncontrolled drugs was often
misclassified and recorded in OTPS under a wrong catalog number. In addition, access to the
pharmacy stockroom was unrestricted; and there was inadequate control over expired drugs.
These internal control weaknesses are discussed in the following sections.

Noncontrolled Drugs are Issued Without Proper Requisitions

The Pharmacy stockroom issued noncontrolled drugs to the Pharmacy subdivisions
without requiring authorized written requisitions. At times, drugs were issued based on verbal
requests or requests written on small pieces of paper or post-it notes. Therefore, there is no
documentation to verify that the requisition of noncontrolled drugs was approved and authorized.
The Pharmacy stockroom also issued noncontrolled drugs directly to nurses and patient units,
thereby bypassing the Pharmacy subdivisions.

10 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_059A_page_14
Noncontrolled drugs can be issued in two ways. Drugs that are unique to a specific
Pharmacy subdivision are purchased by the Assistant Director of the Pharmacy stockroom upon
request. These drugs are transferred to the requesting subdivision after delivery is checked for
accuracy.

Drugs that are of general use are issued directly from the stockroom. For these
noncontrolled drugs, subdivision personnel identify the quantity of drugs needed in weekly issue
books. These are OTPS printouts that list all the drugs used by a particular subdivision. The
Pharmacy sends the printouts to the subdivisions so that the quantity needed for the week can be
indicated next to the drug listed. When the printout is returned to the stockroom, the requested
drugs are prepared for distribution and the actual quantity of drugs issued is noted in the issue
book. Any additional drugs issued during the week are also noted in the subdivisions’ issue
books. At the end of each weekly cycle, the quantity of issued drugs are totaled and entered in
OTPS perpetual inventory system.

We found that the Pharmacy stockroom did not require the weekly issue books to be
signed off by authorized personnel from the Pharmacy subdivisions. Such a signature would
indicate approval for the requested medication. As for drugs unique to the subdivisions, the
Assistant Director of the Pharmacy stockroom placed orders with vendors based on verbal
requests or on requests written on small pieces of paper or post-it notes, (which were not
retained",28180,4253
Comptroller_Reports/MG03_059A.pdf,1,William,William Brown,70.0,lemma,"Office of the New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_059A_page_15
issued. Therefore, there","frequent daily
requests for additional noncontrolled drugs but did not submit written authorization. We
observed pharmacists from the D-Main Pharmacy subdivision, for example, verbally requesting
noncontrolled drugs several times a day from the stockroom. The stockroom personnel issued the
drugs without requiring any documentation or authorization. The frequent requests for additional
noncontrolled drugs also indicate that the subdivisions are not accurately calculating the level of
medication needed from week to week.

In addition to the drugs issued to the Pharmacy subdivisions, noncontrolled drugs were
issued directly to nurses and patient units, thereby bypassing oversight by pharmacists of the
subdivisions. Again, these drugs were issued without documentation and authorization. This is of
significant concern, since the Assistant Director of the Pharmacy stockroom is generally the only
pharmacist assigned to work in the stockroom (the other stockroom personnel are stockhandlers
and clerks). Therefore, when drugs are directly issued to nurses or patient units, it is very likely
that a pharmacist is not the one issuing the drugs. This creates a potentially hazardous condition,
whereby an incorrect drug could be erroneously issued.

An authorizing signature would indicate approval and document the need for the
requested drugs. It would also hold the signatory responsible for the request. By not requiring
proper documentation and authorization before noncontrolled drugs are issued from the
stockroom, the Pharmacy Department is not adequately safeguarding its inventory of
noncontrolled drugs and ensuring that only drugs approved by authorized hospital personnel are

## MG03_059A_page_15
issued. Therefore, there is a greater potential for errors to occur and for loss due to theft or
misappropriation to go undetected.

Issuances of Noncontrolled Drugs are Not Recorded Properly

We found a number of instances in which issuances of noncontrolled drugs were
recorded in the wrong issue book or not recorded at all. Moreover, the OTPS inventory records
cannot always be up-to-date, given that the usual practice of the Pharmacy stockroom is to record
issuances only once a week. Consequently, the OTPS inventory records are inaccurate.

As discussed above, the Pharmacy stockroom issues noncontrolled drugs to its
subdivisions weekly. The quantities of drugs issued are noted in the subdivision issue books,
and once a week the totals issued is entered in the OTPS inventory system. However, we found
that when drugs were issued outside the weekly cycle, the additional drugs were not always
recorded in the issue books. Therefore, they were not included in the totals entered in the OTPS
system, and there would be no record of the issuances of additional drugs.

In addition, when noncontrolled drugs were issued directly to nurses and patient units, the
issuances of the drugs were always incorrectly recorded in one of the subdivision issue books or
not recorded at all. For example, we observed noncontrolled drugs being issued to the Anesthesia
Department and the Dental Unit, and the quantities were recorded in the B-Main pharmacy
subdivision issue book. Though there is record of the issuance",31668,4779
Comptroller_Reports/MG03_059A.pdf,1,William,William Brown,70.0,lemma,"Office of the New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr.

Noncontrolled Drugs are","needed in emergency situations) and in-patient prescriptions. This pharmacist took the
noncontrolled drugs directly from the stockroom, without recording the quantity in any issue
book. Again, as in the situations described above, there is no record of the issuance of these
drugs.

All inventory transactions—both issuances and receipt—should be immediately recorded
to ensure that management has the most reliable information on the availability of its inventory.
The purpose of a perpetual inventory system, such as the OTPS system, is to maintain accurate,
up-to-date inventory records. Documentation and authorization should be required on all requests
for noncontrolled drugs. Every drug removed from the stockroom should be accounted for,
recorded in an issue book, and immediately recorded in the OTPS perpetual inventory system.
However, in the Pharmacy stockroom, issues of noncontrolled drugs were entered in OTPS only
once a week (based on the quantities listed in the issue books) and there were instances in which
they were not recorded at all. This recording delay causes the inventory records to be inaccurate
and out-of-date, and there is a greater risk that issuances will not be recorded at all. The poor
record-keeping and lack of proper requisitioning creates an atmosphere in which theft and
misappropriation can go undetected. In addition, the inaccuracies in the records could
potentially lead the hospital to run out of noncontrolled but critical pharmaceuticals and could be
causing a larger volume of expired drugs.

Noncontrolled Drugs are Not Purchased and Recorded Properly

Pharmacy officials ordered and received drugs without purchase orders, as required by
HHC. Noncontrolled drugs were received before the purchases were approved, authorized, and
recorded in OTPS. Therefore, the recorded inventory balances for noncontrolled drugs will not
reflect what is actually on hand. Though for the most part purchase orders are eventually
prepared after the drugs are received, the OTPS system will not accurately reflect when drugs
were ordered and when they were received.

When Pharmacy officials determine that drugs should be purchased, the quantity and
description of the drugs should be entered into the OTPS system so that a purchase order can be
prepared. OTPS creates the purchase order, automatically assigning the next available purchase-
order number. The purchase order should be approved and authorized by appropriate Pharmacy
officials before the noncontrolled drugs are ordered from the vendor. The Pharmacy generally
orders its drugs on-line from its primary vendor, or by telephone from other vendors. An order
confirmation is generated after the drugs are ordered. When drugs are received from the
vendors, the receipts should be recorded in OTPS inventory records.

We reviewed all 468 purchase orders’ that were prepared from July 3 through October 1,
2002, and determined that the majority of purchase orders were prepared after the drugs were
ordered and received.

We compared the purchase orders listed in OTPS with the order confirmations and
concluded that 444 (95%) purchase orders were prepared after",35106,5325

Receipt of Noncontrolled","one to 118 days). In addition, when we compared the 468 purchase orders with
the vendors’ packing slips, we found that 398 (85%) of the purchase orders were prepared after
the drugs were delivered. The 398 late purchase orders were prepared on average four days after
the drugs were delivered (with a range of one to 42 days). Consequently, the receipts of drugs
were not recorded in the inventory when they were received, but considerably later.

In addition, receipts of noncontrolled drugs may not be entered into OTPS at all. On the
first day of our inventory count the Assistant Director of the Pharmacy stockroom informed us
that one shipment of a noncontrolled drug, Flutamide 125mg, was never included in the OTPS
inventory records. He stated that the drug became available at an inexpensive price but was not
obtainable through the primary vendor so he purchased it directly from the manufacturer. He
ordered 288 units of the drug on August 1, 2002, and received 280 units in September. However,
a purchase order was never prepared; consequently the drug was not recorded in OTPS. After
we brought this matter to the attention of the Director of the Pharmacy, a purchase order was
created at the end of October 2002, and the receipt of the drug was posted to the OTPS system.

>We originally selected 476 purchase orders, (numbers 8-131030001 to 8-1310300477). Eight had been cancelled,
leaving the 468 that we reviewed.

13 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_059A_page_17
Receipt of Noncontrolled Drugs is Incorrectly Recorded

In addition to the delay in preparing purchase orders, receipts of noncontrolled drugs
have been incorrectly recorded in the OTPS inventory system. Therefore, the inventory balances
for those items are inaccurate and do not reflect what is actually on hand.

All drugs that are purchased and recorded in OTPS have an HHC catalog number. When
a new drug is ordered, a catalog number should be requested from HHC. Instead, when
preparing the purchase order the Pharmacy uses the catalog number of another drug—or possibly
the same drug, but of a different strength or size. Pharmacy personnel said that this is done to
expedite the process, in this way the Pharmacy would not have to request and wait for a new
catalog number. Therefore, the information entered in OTPS will not reflect the actual items
purchased and received, but items that match the catalog number. Thus, the inventory balances
recorded in OTPS do not reflect the actual physical inventory: the quantity of drugs that have a
catalog number will be overstated, and the quantity of drugs actual received will not be recorded
at all.

By allowing drugs to be ordered and received before a purchase order is prepared, the
Pharmacy is circumventing the controls put in place to ensure that only drugs that have been
approved and authorized will be purchased. Also, since there is a time delay in recording these
purchases, the OTPS inventory records will not be",38383,5851

Unrestricted access to","since there is a time delay in recording these
purchases, the OTPS inventory records will not be up-to-date. Moreover, the Pharmacy
Department entered incorrect data in the OTPS inventory system. Therefore, the recorded
inventory balances for noncontrolled drugs will never reflect what is actually on hand. This
creates a greater potential for theft and misappropriation.

Unrestricted Access to the Stockroom

The Pharmacy has inadequate controls to safeguard the inventory of noncontrolled drugs.
The Pharmacy stockroom, in the basement of Kings County Hospital, consists of three areas: the
office area, the stock area for noncontrolled drugs, and the controlled drug room, which is locked
behind double doors.

We observed that non-stockroom employees had unrestricted access to the stockroom
area. Everyone picking up drug orders—pharmacists or technicians from the Pharmacy
subdivisions or nurses from patient units, was allowed in the area that houses noncontrolled
drugs.

Furthermore, there was no separation in the stockroom between the office area and the
stock area. Anyone working in the office had free access to the stockroom at all times. In fact,
the data entry clerk, who is responsible for all the record-keeping for the Pharmacy is stationed
in the stockroom office. Her duties include preparation of the purchase orders, entries in
OTPS—both receipt and issuances—and she occasionally assists in checking the accuracy of
deliveries from vendors. Essentially, she has unlimited access to the inventory records, as well as
to noncontrolled drugs.

14 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_059A_page_18
Unrestricted access to the stockroom allows thefts and misappropriations to go
undetected. It is the hospital’s responsibility to immediately institute controls to ensure that only
authorized personnel have access to the stock area. Furthermore, Pharmacy officials should
consider moving the stockroom clerk to a workstation outside the stockroom, thereby ensuring
that employees who perform record-keeping functions do not have access to the goods.

After we discussed our concerns with Pharmacy officials, they installed a metal divider
with a door to separate the office area and the stock area. However, we do not know whether
Pharmacy officials took any further steps to restrict access to the stock area.

Inadequate Controls Over Expired Drugs

The Pharmacy has inadequate controls over its expired drugs. It does not maintain its
own records of the quantity or value of expired drugs and does not properly safeguard those
drugs before they are removed from the hospital. Moreover, the expired drugs were not removed
from the OTPS inventory records.* Therefore, the inventory balances are inaccurate, since they
include drugs that can no longer be used.

Furthermore, the hospital procedure regarding expired drugs is insufficient. According to
the Pharmacy policy and procedure, Disposition of Unused Medication Returned to the
Pharmacy From In-Patient and Out-Patient Units, “All out-of-date or deteriorated drugs are to
be returned to the Pharmacy Stores Center, . . . who shall return them to the vendor for credit or
replacement.” This procedure does not address the tracking, maintaining",41426,6335

room, since other","Director, when there is
a sufficient accumulation of expired drugs, Pharmacy officials schedule a pick-up date with
Guaranteed Returns. Before controlled drugs leave the hospital, Pharmacy personnel list all
items being returned. However, no such list is prepared for expired noncontrolled drugs.
According to the Pharmacy Director, because of the large volume of expired noncontrolled drugs
it is not possible to generate an accurate list. Instead, a few weeks after the drugs are picked up,
Guaranteed Returns sends the Pharmacy a list of the expired drugs.

The list is broken down by drugs that are returnable and non-returnable. Drugs that can
be returned are sent to the Pharmacy’s primary vendor or to the manufacturer. The Pharmacy
should: (1) receive a check for the value of the drugs, or (2) obtain a credit to its account, or (3)
obtain replacement drugs. Nonreturnable drugs are disposed of by Guaranteed Returns.

Under the current procedure, Pharmacy personnel do not know whether the list of drugs
submitted by Guaranteed Returns is accurate nor whether the hospital is receiving the maximum
credit for the returnable drugs. In addition, until they are picked up, the expired noncontrolled
drugs are kept in a room in the basement, near the Pharmacy stockroom. Although the door is
locked, we were told and observed that non-Pharmacy hospital employees have access to that

Good internal controls and business practices dictate that Pharmacy personnel track all
expired drugs, that drugs be properly safeguarded, that checks and credits for returned drugs be
tracked and applied against payments, and that expired drugs be removed from OTPS inventory
records.

Conclusion

Kings County Hospital Pharmacy Department has serious weaknesses in keeping
accurate inventory records and maintaining adequate controls over the safeguarding of
noncontrolled drugs. Based on our observations of the Pharmacy’s inventory operations, it
appears that an environment exists in which it would be difficult, if not impossible, to detect theft
and misappropriation of noncontrolled drugs.

Noncontrolled drugs are issued and purchased without proper approval and authorization.
The recording of those transactions—issuances and receipts—is haphazard and creates
inaccuracies in the inventory balance. Moreover, the safeguarding of non-controlled drugs and

expired drugs are insufficient. These conditions contributed to the 71 percent discrepancy, that
we found during our inventory count, between the physical inventory and the inventory balances
recorded in OTPS. Furthermore, after conducting their year-end physical inventory count,
Pharmacy officials adjusted the inventory records to reflect the count results, without
investigating the discrepancies.

The goal of effective inventory management is to ensure that an adequate amount of
goods is on hand to meet operating needs, that inventory costs are appropriate, and that assets are
safeguarded. Accurate inventory records are necessary to maintain sufficient control over
inventory levels.

Kings County Hospital should take immediate action and require the Pharmacy
Department to institute proper controls over its noncontrolled drugs. We believe that the
recommendations herein address many of the problems identified. However, it is management’s
responsibility to ensure that proper controls are in place and are adhered to.

Recommendations
Kings County Hospital Pharmacy officials should:

1. Require periodic physical counts of the inventory to verify the accuracy of its
inventory records, and investigate all variances to determine their cause.

HHC Response: “The Pharmacy Department will maintain a perpetual inventory and
perform physical counts on a monthly basis to verify the accuracy of its records. Any
variances will be investigated and discussed with the Director of Pharmacy.

vastly reduce the need for year-end adjustments. The Director of Pharmacy will review
and authorize any adjustments.”

3. Ensure that a written authorized requisition is obtained for all noncontrolled drugs
issued from the Pharmacy stockroom. The requisitions should include the names and
quantities of drugs requested, the names of subdivision personnel requesting the drug,
and the authorizing signature.

not being maintained. Furthermore, Materials Management officials did not investigate the
discrepancies. Making adjustments to inventory records without proper investigation and
adequate justification removes a key control to safeguarding assets. Also, adjusting the
inventory balances at fiscal year end makes loss due to theft and misappropriation more difficult
to detect and renders the hospital vulnerable to running out of critical supplies.

Inadequate Controls over Recording of Medical and Surgical Supplies

The Materials Management Department does not immediately record the issuances from
the stockroom of medical and surgical supplies in the OTPS inventory system. Instead, every
month the department totals the quantities of each item distributed to the various supply rooms in
the hospital and then records the totals in OTPS. Therefore, the inventory records for medical
and surgical supplies are not accurate and up-to-date.

Materials Management uses two computerized systems to track its inventory: the OTPS
system and the Scan Module system. The quantities of medical and surgical supplies issued daily
are recorded in the Scan Module system, which is summarized each month and entered in the
OTPS system.

Each day the stockroom staff inspects the inventory levels in assigned supply rooms.
They use scan-guns to scan the barcodes of the empty supply bins. The scan-guns register the
maximum capacity of each bin to be replenished. Once all supply areas are scanned, the data
stored in the scan-gun are downloaded into the Scan Module computer system. The computer
processes the information and prints pick lists. After the items from the pick lists are pulled and
distributed to the supply rooms, the Scan Module is updated with the actual quantity of items
distributed. Each month, the number of specific items distributed to each supply room is totaled
and entered in the OTPS inventory system. However, we found that in fact it may take",58862,9042

Discrepancies Between the","for the entries to be made. On the first day of our inventory count, October 29, 2002,
the September issues from the Scan Module system were just being entered in the OTPS system.
Obviously, those delays have a substantial impact on the accuracy of the inventory records.

In addition to the pick lists generated from the Scan Module system, written requests
come from various supply areas for specific medical and surgical supplies. Although these
issuances should be entered in OTPS when dispensed, we found that entries were not being made
until the end of the month. As of October 29, 2002, no October written requests for supplies had
been entered in OTPS.

All inventory transactions—both issuances and receipt—should be immediately recorded
to ensure that management has the most reliable information on the availability of its inventory.
The purpose of such a perpetual inventory system as OTPS is to maintain accurate, up-to-date
inventory records. Therefore, issuances of medical and surgical supplies should be recorded
immediately in OTPS. In Materials Management, issues of medical and surgical supplies were
not entered in OTPS for approximately two months. These record-keeping delays render the
inventory records inaccurate and unreliable. They also contribute to errors in the inventory that
might go undetected. For better controls over the safeguarding of assets, Materials Management
should record all transactions promptly and accurately and should designate the personnel
responsible for keeping the OTPS system up-to-date.

Discrepancies Between the Scan Module and OTPS Systems

Besides the delay in entering information in OTPS, we found that there were many
discrepancies between the data in Scan Module and in OTPS. In many cases, the two systems
had different catalog numbers for the same item. In other cases, there were differences in the
number of items issued: in Scan Module items were recorded by individual unit (e.g., one
feeding tube) and in OTPS items were recorded by the case (e.g., one case containing 50 feeding
tubes).

After conducting our inventory count of the medical and surgical supplies, and adjusting
the recorded inventory balances to reflect all the unrecorded September and October 2002
issuances (as discussed in the previous section),° we met with Materials Management officials to
determine the cause for the 91 percent error rate between the physical and adjusted recorded
inventory. The officials could not account for the differences. However, the Materials
Management clerk, who enters the issues, informed us that the Scan Module and OTPS systems
are not compatible and the records therein will not reconcile. Since we had used the data from
the Scan Module system to make adjustments to the OTPS inventory balances, the adjustments
we made did not accurately account for the September and October issuances.

Specifically, many of the catalog numbers in the Scan Module system are obsolete and do
not match the catalog numbers in OTPS, even though every item in the medical and surgical
supplies",62034,9547
Comptroller_Reports/MG03_059A.pdf,1,William,William Brown,70.0,lemma,"Office of the New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_059A_page_27
Using both lists","OTPS inventory, using
the same valid catalog numbers. Therefore, in order to correctly record the issues of medical and
surgical supplies in OTPS, Materials Management must use the same valid catalog number.
Since some issuances from the Scan Module system are categorized by obsolete catalog
numbers, these issuances have to be converted to the valid OTPS catalog numbers.

When the Materials Management clerk knows the correct catalog number, he accurately
records the issuance in OTPS; otherwise he records the issuance in OTPS using the catalog
number for another item that best fits the description of the issued item. However, he does not
document the change in catalog numbers.

After we were informed of this situation, we asked for the list of obsolete catalog
numbers used in Scan Module, as well as the comparable catalog numbers in OTPS. In this way,
we wanted to use the list to adjust the recorded OTPS inventory balances to account for all the
issuances, in order to determine the actual balance that should have been reflected in OTPS on
the day of our physical count of the inventory.

Officials from Materials Management created a list of comparable catalog numbers.
When we continued to find problems adjusting the balances, they submitted a second list of
comparable catalog numbers.

° Issuances for the two months of September and October had not been entered into OTPS when we conducted our
physical count of the inventory from October 29 through October 31.

23 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_059A_page_27
Using both lists, we determined that various quantities of a total of 189 items were issued
during September and October from the stockroom, using obsolete catalog numbers. For 129
items, Materials Management had a comparable OTPS catalog number. For example, 8,950 of
one item with the description “syringe w/o needle luer loc” were issued with the obsolete catalog
number (10-80-000-40); the comparable catalog number, according to Materials Management, is
10-80-000-68. For the remaining 60 items, Materials Management had no comparable catalog
numbers. For example, 300 of one item with the description “tube vacutainer red silicone” were
issued with the obsolete catalog number 10-86-003-82; Materials Management did not give us a
comparable catalog number but instead said that the catalog number was “invalid” and that it
was “discontinued.” Even though all items, to be purchased, must have an OTPS catalog
number, Materials Management could not supply us with valid catalog numbers. Thus, it
appears that the quantities issued for those 60 items were never recorded in OTPS. Therefore, the
recorded balances in OTPS are inaccurate and cannot be relied upon to have accurate
information on the availability of medical and surgical supplies.

There are additional discrepancies between the Scan Module and OTPS systems, since
each system records the units of measure differently. For many items, the inventory in OTPS is
recorded by case or box, whereas in the Scan Module system items are issued and recorded",65458,10100

Recommendations
Kings","by the differences between the Scan Module and OTPS systems
have been a continual problem in Materials Management. Some of the catalog numbers used in
the Scan Module system have been obsolete for many years, requiring the Materials
Management clerk to try to remember (or guess) the valid catalog number before entering the
issuance in OTPS. In addition, it appears that obsolete catalog numbers may not always be
converted to a valid catalog number. Though Materials Management officials could update the
Scan Module to reflect the valid catalog numbers, they have chosen not to.

Delays in recording issued inventory in OTPS, as well as the recording of invalid and
inconsistent information, contribute to errors in the inventory that make it difficult, if not
impossible, to detect theft and misappropriation of medical and surgical supplies. Those
conditions contributed to the 91 percent discrepancy, that we found during our inventory count,
between the physical inventory and the inventory balances recorded in OTPS. Furthermore, after
conducting their year-end physical inventory count, Materials Management officials adjusted the
inventory records to reflect the count results without investigating the discrepancies.

The goal of effective inventory management is to ensure that an adequate amount of
goods is on hand to meet operating needs, that inventory costs are appropriate, and that assets are
safeguarded. For better controls, Materials Management should record all transactions promptly
and accurately, and the data recorded in its two systems should be correct and compatible.

Recommendations
Kings County Hospital Materials Management officials should:

16. Require periodic physical counts of the inventory to verify the accuracy of the
inventory records, and investigate all variances to determine their cause.

HHC Response: “The Materials Management Department will maintain a perpetual
inventory and perform physical counts on a monthly basis to verify the accuracy of its
records. Any variances will be investigated and discussed with the Materials
Management Director. Additionally, the Controller's Office will conduct independent
physical counts on a quarterly basis.”

17. Ensure that appropriate adjustments are made to the OTPS system to accurately
reflect the inventory of medical and surgical supplies. Materials Management
officials should review, approve, and document all adjustments.

HHC Response: “Maintaining a physical inventory system, as described above, will
vastly reduce the need for year-end adjustments. The Materials Management Director
will review and authorize any adjustments.”

18. Ensure that all issues from the Materials Management stockroom are immediately

HOSPITAL CENTER, NEW YORK CITY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS CORPORATION,
OVER NON-CONTROLLED DRUGS AND MEDICAL AND SURGICAL SUPPLIES (Audit #
MG03-059A)

Dear Mr, Brooks:

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the draft audit report concerning the Corporation's inventory
controls over non-controlled drugs and medical and surgical supplies at Kings County Hospital Center,

While pharmaceutical and medical surgical supplies are properly accounted for at the Facility’s receiving area
and delivered to the respective departments, the Facility will implement and utilize the Corporation's Other
Than Personnel Services (OTPS) computerized perpetual inventory system as an important component of
inventory control. It will ensure appropriate recording, accounting and safeguarding of our assets.

The Facility’s Departments are expected to complete the conversion to a computerized perpetual inventory
system, including the training of personnel with the appropriate segregation of responsibilities, by December
2003.

The system will enable the Facility to:

e Obtain current quantity, dollar value and usage history",74086,11409

G. Proctor, Chief Operating Officer/CFO","that will enable expeditious review of purchases, inventory management, and
payments,

In response to your report, the Facility has in fact begun corrective action in several areas prior to the
completion of the audit, For instance, the pharmacy stack area has been properly secured with the installation
of an iron gate, crash trays are prepared in the main pharmacy area, orders will not be place without the

correct catalog number and expired drugs marked for return will include a comprehensive fist for a full
accounting of those drugs.

in addition, the Facility is in the process of implementing the use of the PYXIS system, a reliable automated
distribution system, in 13 key areas such as the emergency rooms, nursing units and operating room suites.

We do object however, to the auditor's representation of the inventory discrepancies in the aggregate whereby
inventory overages and shortages were combined. This is neither fair nor appropriate and can be misleading.
Overages and shortages should be netted against each other or presented separately, to properly reflect the
value of inventory variances.

Attachment | is the HHC’s detailed response. Attachment II is the Audit Implementation Plan, which
addresses all the recommendations cited in the report.

Should you have any questions concerning this response, please contact Mr. Alex Scoufaras, Assistant Vice
President, Intemal Audits at (212) 730-3123.

Dear Residents of the City of New York:

My office has audited the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) to
determine whether it had controls in place to evaluate the efforts made in reducing Emergency
Department (ED) wait times. We perform audits such as this as a means of increasing
accountability and ensuring that City agencies are operating in the best interest of the public.

This audit determined that Kings County, Lincoln, and Elmhurst hospitals failed to
provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of reductions in ED wait times. The limited
documentation these facilities provided generally did not reflect changes before and after the
initiatives to reduce ED wait times were implemented. As a result, the audit was unable to
determine the extent to which these hospitals formally evaluated and measured their wait time
reduction efforts.

To address this issue, the audit recommended that HHC should assess the effect of
initiatives undertaken to reduce ED wait times by collecting adequate supporting documentation
and engaging in a thorough and comprehensive evaluation to determine whether goals are
being met and resources are being efficiently allocated.

The results of the audit have been discussed with HHC officials, and their comments
have been considered in preparing this",208,30

Audit Report on the Evaluation of the Efforts to
Manage","Manage Emergency Department Wait Times by Kings
County, Lincoln, and Elmhurst Hospitals

MD13-112A
|

AUDIT REPORT IN BRIEF

This audit determined whether the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) had
controls in place to evaluate the efforts made in reducing Emergency Department (ED) wait
times.

According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), ED visits nationwide increased 32 percent
between 1999 and 2009, resulting in ED overcrowding and increased wait times in some
hospitals. New York State has the fourth-longest average ED wait time in the nation (6.1 hours).
ED crowding in the United States has been called a “national epidemic” by the Institute of
Medicine. '

HHC’s 11 acute care hospitals reported 1,190,413 ED visits in 2012. Since 2007, HHC
hospitals have been using an approach called Breakthrough, based on an efficiency process
developed by Toyota, to address ED wait time delays as well as to identify inefficient processes,
improve patient care, and generate savings and new revenue.

Audit Findings and Conclusion

Kings County, Lincoln, and Elmhurst hospitals failed to provide sufficient evidence to support
their claims of reductions in ED wait times. The limited documentation provided by these
facilities generally did not reflect changes before and after the initiatives to reduce ED wait times
were implemented. As a result, we were unable to determine the extent to which these
hospitals formally evaluated and measured their wait time reduction efforts. Thus, while Kings
County and Lincoln Hospitals publicly reported reductions in wait times in",4105,454
Comptroller_Reports/MD13_112A.pdf,1,Brooklyn,Brooklyn Health South,55.172413793103445,lemma,"at three HHC member hospitals: Kings County
(Brooklyn), Lincoln (Bronx), and Elmhurst (Queens).

All HHC","increased 32 percent nationwide according to the CDC.
Increased ED volume has resulted in ED overcrowding and increased wait times in some
hospitals. ED crowding in the United States has become so severe that the Institute of Medicine
calls it a “national epidemic.” New York City hospitals that are members of the HHC system are
not immune to problems with wait times in EDs. In 2012, HHC reported that 1,190,413 ED visits
were made to its 11 acute care hospitals.

Since 2007, in an effort to address delays in ED wait times as well as other issues with hospital
operations, HHC member hospitals have been using an approach called Breakthrough, based
on an efficiency process developed by Toyota.* Breakthrough is designed to identify inefficient
processes, improve patient care and patient and staff experience, and generate savings and
new revenue.

One of the tools Breakthrough uses to reduce ED wait times are Rapid Improvement Events
(RIEs), intense workshops designed to address operational weaknesses. Through the RIEs,
operational improvements are designed and tested, with the goal of eliminating process steps
that have little value. According to HHC officials, the factors that contribute to long wait times
can vary significantly from hospital to hospital. Consequently, HHC has determined that each of
its member hospitals should be primarily responsible for the identification, implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation of initiatives focused on reducing wait times. This audit focused on
the ED initiatives taken to reduce wait times at three HHC member hospitals: Kings County
(Brooklyn","Brooklyn), Lincoln (Bronx), and Elmhurst (Queens).

All HHC hospitals but Elmhurst use the Quadramed Computerized Patient Record System
(Quadramed) to assist management in their daily activities; Elmhurst uses a similar computer
patient record system called Allscript. Both Quadramed and Allscript display a whiteboard to
monitor daily bed availability, equipment, and staffing assignments which are updated in real-
time. The systems also display a dashboard which reports overall status of the ED in near real
time. The information displayed on the dashboard includes:

1. The number of patients in the ED;

The number of patients checked in and waiting to be triaged;?

The number of patients who have been triaged and are waiting to be seen by a
physician; and

4. The number of patients who have been seen by a physician and are waiting for a bed to
become available.

Dashboard reports also show historical trending on ED volume and throughput (i.e., processing
time) metrics, including the aggregate times from the patients’ (1) arrival in the ED to triage, (2)
arrival to first provider (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, resident, or attending physician),

? The Toyota Production System (“lean methodology”) is used by numerous companies across various industries to reduce
inefficiencies and improve the overall value of their end product to customers.
3 “Triage” refers to the process of determining the priority of patients’ treatments based on severity of condition.

2009 to June of 2013.

° According to a March 20, 2012, report to the HHC Board of Directors, Kings County Hospital was recognized nationally for using
Breakthrough methodologies to transform its ED, improve efficiency and patient flow, and shorten patient ED wait times. The report
states that the total time a patient spent in the Kings County Hospital ED was reduced by 36 minutes.

Office of New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer MD13-112A 7


## MD13_112A_page_11
However, for the initiatives related to the post-triage and overflow response processes, hospital
officials were unable to provide sufficient evidence that these initiatives were formally evaluated.
The RIE related to the post-triage initiative began in 2010 and was closed in 2011. Hospital
officials provided us with no baseline figures against which to measure any productivity gains.
The only documents they provided were productivity graphs for September and October 2013
(absent the data supporting these graphs), two years after the initiative was implemented, and
well after any productivity changes resulting from the initiative would have been evident.

The overflow response initiative, which began in December 2011 and is on-going, was designed
to address overcrowding in the ED. Hospital officials perform daily huddles with staff and use
NEDOCS to manage","manage bed capacity for admitted patients. Hospital officials provided a protocol
sheet, “huddle” follow-up sheets, and a graph for patient dwell time.’ However, the graph did
not reflect a baseline or target time, the time period of the evaluation, or the reduction in dwell
time from 17 hours to nine hours claimed by hospital officials.

For the initiative related to staffing levels, Kings County officials contended that an evaluation
was not necessary. However, without an evaluation, we question how officials were able to
assess the degree to which the initiative was successful or whether it had any impact at all.

In May 2012, HHC publicly reported that Kings County lowered its wait time throughput metrics.
HHC did not indicate the specific initiatives taken to reduce the wait times. However, the
newsletter reported that average wait times from log-in to triage improved 52 percent in the
adult ED and 62 percent in the pediatric ED, going from 31 minutes to 15 minutes and from 52
minutes to 20 minutes, respectively. It did not indicate the time periods for the claimed
reductions. We requested the analyses supporting the reductions, but never received them.
Consequently, we were unable to confirm the reductions claimed in the newsletter.

Lincoln Hospital Initiatives

Lincoln Hospital officials provided limited or no evidence that they conducted an adequate
evaluation of the efforts undertaken to reduce wait times for the 10 key initiatives identified.
Based on our walk-through meetings with hospital officials and the various materials they
provided",22017,3270

Recommendation

1. HHC should assess the effect of initiatives undertaken to reduce ED wait times
by collecting adequate supporting documentation and engaging in a thorough
and comprehensive evaluation to determine whether goals are being met and
resources are being efficiently allocated.

HHC Response: “We accept your recommendation and will strive to improve
evaluation and supportive documentation for our continuing work on reducing
wait times.”

DETAILED SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY

We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions
based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable
basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objective. This audit was conducted
in accordance with the audit responsibilities of the City Comptroller as set forth in Chapter 5,
§93, of the New York City Charter.

The primary audit scope was Fiscal year 2013. However, some of the efforts we identified to
reduce patient wait times in the ED based on our walk-throughs and observations began in
2008. Although some efforts began years ago, they are still ongoing because of continuous
changes in ED environments.

We requested the ED organizational charts for all 11 acute care hospitals, but received and
reviewed organization charts of only five of the hospitals—Coney","Coney Island, Bellevue, Elmhurst,
Kings County, and Woodhull. HHC did not provide us with organizational charts for the
remaining six hospitals.

We selected Kings County Hospital as the hospital for our initial walk-through meeting because
of an HHC Today May 2012 newsletter promoting the success of the “Breakthrough”
methodology implemented at Kings County and a reduction in wait time of 36 minutes. Lincoln
and Elmhurst hospitals were selected based on an analysis of the number of emergency
department visits by patients during 2011—with both having the highest numbers of visitors.

To obtain an understanding of patient flow in the emergency departments for the three hospitals
in our sample, we requested the hospitals’ policies and procedures related to ED wait times and
conducted interviews with the chiefs of emergency medicine and other officials at Kings County,
Lincoln, and Elmhurst hospitals. We reviewed the /C/S ED Module User’s Guide.'* With regard
to the hospitals’ policies and procedures, we received only a one-page procedure for “Visual
Triage and Log-In” from Kings County on December 17, 2013 — approximately eight months
after we requested it. HHC did not provide any other policies or procedures for Kings County or
the other two hospitals, Lincoln and Elmhurst.

To obtain an understanding of the computer patient record system used by HHC, we conducted
a walk-through with the chief medical informatics officer and other officials. We also reviewed
the median wait times for the throughput metrics reported by HHC from its dashboard reports",39250,6020
Comptroller_Reports/MD13_112A.pdf,1,Medicaid,Medicaid reimbursement,53.333333333333336,lemma,to the federal agency Centers for Medicare & Medicaid. It is this level of monitoring and,"problematic in getting to a joint understanding of
what was being measured and the interpretation of performance data.

ED wait time, as defined by the ACEM and reported online’, refers to the “average time patients spend
in the ER before being seen a provider (usually a doctor)” and is made up of the time from arrival to
triage plus the time from triage to provider. Clearly, sicker patients wait much less time than less acutely
ill patients; and this is facilitated by the triage system, with categories 1-5 based on reducing risk of life
threatening illness to that patient. Category 1 patients (the potentially sickest category) had a waiting
time of between zero and 6 minutes during the month of June 2014. During the period calendar years
2012 and 2013, average waiting time for all triage category adult patients at Lincoln Hospital was 72
minutes, at Kings County was 75 minutes and at Elmhurst was 86 minutes, with little or no improvement
during those 2 years.

ED cycle time or length of stay is defined as the time from arrival to release, and for admitted patients it
is the time from arrival to the time of departure from the ED to another part of the hospital. Along with
the “waiting time” in the previous paragraph, these times are routinely monitored at each facility and
reported to facility oversight committees and the HHC Board of Directors. In addition, ED cycle times are
reported to the federal agency Centers for Medicare & Medicaid","Medicaid. It is this level of monitoring and
oversight which has been steadily built up over the last three years that underpins our view that our

hospitals did in fact “measure their wait time efforts”. Average ED cycle time for admitted patients for
10 HHC Emergency Departments improved more than 20% from 653 minutes to 514 minutes between
January 2013 and June 2014.

Further, an examination of data captured from our monitoring system in Figure 1 gives an insight as to
why some improvements may have been appropriately claimed with two or more months of
improvement in a particular measurement. It is also clear from the same figure that some of those
claims may have been premature, in that the improvements could not be sustained. In an environment
as complex as a busy Emergency Department there are many potential reasons why improvement is not

sustained.

FM01-195A

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Children of Bellevue, Inc., is a nonprofit organization that initiates,
develops, and funds special programs and acts as an advocate for children and their
families within the Bellevue Hospital Center. The Children of Bellevue is subject to
the rules and regulations adopted by the New York City Health and Hospitals
Corporation (HHC). HHC rules governing the Children of Bellevue include
Operating Procedure No. 10-20, issued in July 1987, that sets forth the procedures
and regulations that must be followed by HHC “Auxiliary Organizations.” For
purposes of this report, we refer to the Children of Bellevue as the “Auxiliary.”

Among the services sponsored by the Auxiliary are a child protection and
development center, which seeks to minimize the trauma of child abuse, and an
early literacy program. The Auxiliary sponsors fund-raising events and solicits
donations to support its activities from individuals, corporations, foundations, and
government agencies. The Auxiliary also generates income from investments and
from interest received on bank deposits. In calendar year 2000, the Auxiliary had
total support and revenue of $1,640,946 and expenses of $1,279,789.

The audit’s objectives were to determine whether revenues and expenses
are",94,14

As an alternative, given the minimal","Auxiliary paid New York University (NYU)
$194,234 without adequate documentation. The payment was to reimburse NYU
for the salaries of three NYU employees who purportedly provided services to
Bellevue Hospital’s pediatric programs. The Auxiliary also paid $2,739 for
questionable items, including gifts and flowers for Board members and
employees, in violation of HHC Operating Procedures.

Finally, the Auxiliary was not paid by Cinemat, a concessionaire that
operates the videocassette vending machine in Bellevue Hospital. As a result of
our bringing this issue to the attention of Auxiliary and Bellevue officials, the
Auxiliary recouped $1,136 from Cinemat for the period November 1999 to
December 2001. However, we cannot be assured that Auxiliary received the
correct amount due since the contract does not require that Cinemat submit gross
revenue reports to the Auxiliary and the Auxiliary did not review Cinemat’s
accounting records.

Consequently, our report recommended that the Auxiliary ensure that:

e All payments for reimbursing salaries of NYU employees are
supported by a formal agreement with NYU. The agreement should
specify the services to be provided, the hours to be worked, and the
amounts to be paid. In addition, the agreement should require that
NYU submit documentation, such as timesheets or timecards, showing
the hours worked and services provided, to support amounts requested.

e It pays only expenses that are in accordance with HHC Operating
Procedures.

e The Cinemat contract is revised to include a provision requiring that
the concessionaire submit gross revenue reports to support fees","fees due.
As an alternative, given the minimal amount of fees involved, the
contract should be revised to include a flat fee payment rather than a
fee based on a percentage of gross revenue.

Hospital, and Auxiliary officials during and at the conclusion of this audit. A
preliminary draft report was sent to HHC, Bellevue, and Auxiliary officials and
discussed at an exit conference held on March 12, 2002. On March 25, 2002, we
submitted a draft report to HHC, Bellevue, and Auxiliary officials with a request
for comments. On April 8, 2002, we received a written response from HHC
officials on behalf of Bellevue and Auxiliary officials. HHC officials agreed with
the audit findings and recommendations, and indicated that all the
recommendations will be implemented by July 15, 2002.

FM01-195A

INTRODUCTION

Background

The Children of Bellevue, Inc., is a nonprofit organization that initiates, develops, and funds
special programs and acts as an advocate for children and their families within the Bellevue
Hospital Center.’ The Children of Bellevue is subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the
New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC). HHC rules governing the Children of
Bellevue include Operating Procedure No. 10-20, issued in July 1987, that sets forth the procedures
and regulations that must be followed by HHC “Auxiliary Organizations.” For purposes of this
report, we refer to the Children of Bellevue as the “Auxiliary.”

Among the services sponsored by the Auxiliary are a child protection and development
center, which seeks to minimize the trauma of child abuse, and an early literacy program, which
enables volunteers to regularly read to youngsters in various hospital divisions.

The Auxiliary sponsors fund-raising events and solicits donations to support its activities
from individuals, corporations, foundations, and government agencies. The Auxiliary also generates
income from investments and from interest received on bank deposits.

Funds received by the Auxiliary are classified as either “unrestricted” or “temporarily
restricted.” Unrestricted funds may be used for any purchase that the Auxiliary deems necessary for
patient-related care. Temporarily restricted funds",5286,805

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Auxiliary revenues and expenses were accurately recorded on the Auxiliary’s financial
statements and expenses were generally reasonable, appropriate, and complied with prescribed
guidelines and bylaws. Specifically:

e The Auxiliary properly recorded contributions and investment interest; reconciled the
cash receipts to the bank statements; and deposited receipts into its bank accounts in a
timely manner.

e Expenditures were accurately posted to the general ledger and matched corresponding
invoices or authorizations.

e Adjusting entries and estimates made on revenue and expense accounts were appropriate
and reasonable.

e Individual gifts of securities were properly safeguarded and accurately reported on the
financial statements.

e Auxiliary employees were paid the correct amounts.

However, there were some weaknesses in the Auxiliary’s financial and operating
practices. Specifically, the Auxiliary paid New York University (NYU) $194,234 without
adequate documentation. It paid $2,739 for questionable items, including gifts and flowers for
Board members and employees. It did not ensure that a concessionaire paid required fees","fees. These
issues are discussed in further detail in the following sections of this report.


## FM01_195A_page_11
Lack of Documentation to Support
Payments to New York University

The Auxiliary paid $194,234 to NYU without adequate documentation. According to
Auxiliary officials, the $194,234 was paid to NYU to reimburse it for the salaries of three NYU
employees (a program coordinator, a psychologist, and a pediatrician) who purportedly provided
services to Bellevue Hospital’s pediatric programs.

The payments to NYU were not adequately supported by the Auxiliary. Specifically,
there was no written agreement with NYU indicating what services were to be provided, the
hours to be worked, and the amounts to be paid. In addition, the only records supporting these
payments were invoices from NYU; no timesheets, timecards, or other documentation were
provided. Without such documentation, we cannot be assured that the services the Auxiliary
paid for were actually received by the hospital.

Questionable Expenses

The Auxiliary made questionable payments totaling $2,448 for expenses that were not
directly related to patient care, in violation of HHC Operating Procedure 10-20. Specifically, the
Auxiliary paid $1,324 for cards, gifts, and flowers for Auxiliary employees and Board members,
$300 for tickets to a benefit sponsored by another Bellevue Hospital auxiliary, $240 for membership
dues, and $584 for an announcement in an obituary listing.

In addition, the Auxiliary reimbursed an employee $491 for a two-night stay at a hotel.
However, according to HHC Operating Procedure 10-10, the maximum reimbursement amount
for",14141,2115

However, according to HHC Operating Procedure 10-10, the maximum reimbursement amount
for a two-night hotel stay is $200.

Fees","Fees Owed by Concessionaire

The Auxiliary was not paid by Cinemat, a concessionaire that operates the videocassette
vending machine in Bellevue Hospital. Cinemat’s contract calls for it to pay the Auxiliary 7
percent of its gross video rental revenue. As a result of our bringing this issue to the attention of
Auxiliary and Bellevue officials, the Auxiliary recouped $1,136 from Cinemat for the period
November 1999 to December 2001. However, we cannot be assured that Auxiliary received the
correct amount due since the contract does not require that Cinemat submit gross revenue reports
to the Auxiliary and the Auxiliary did not review Cinemat’s accounting records.


## FM01_195A_page_12
Recommendations
The Auxiliary should ensure that:

1. All payments for reimbursing salaries of NYU employees are supported by a formal
agreement with NYU. The agreement should specify the services to be provided, the
hours to be worked, and the amounts to be paid. In addition, the agreement should
require that NYU submit documentation, such as timesheets or timecards, showing
the hours worked and services provided, to support amounts requested.

HHC Response: “Bellevue Hospital will execute a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’
agreement with NYU for the provision of services to Bellevue Hospital Center. Further,
this agreement shall contain provisions concerning hours to be worked and the amount to
be paid for services rendered.

“The Memorandum of Understanding shall also require that NYU employees sign in an
official log book which, when co-signed by a department supervisor, will attest to
services rendered on a",15814,2373

service rendered, before payment can be made.”

2. It pays only expenses that are in accordance with HHC Operating Procedures.

HHC Response: “The Auxiliary accepts this recommendation and will only pay expenses
that are in accordance with HHC Operating Procedures. Also, the Auxiliary’s
disbursement procedures will be strengthened to ensure that all future payments are made
within established guidelines, as required by NYC HHC.”

3. The Cinemat contract is revised to include a provision requiring that the
concessionaire submit gross revenue reports to support fees","fees due. As an alternative,
given the minimal amount of fees involved, the contract should be revised to include
a flat fee payment rather than a fee based on a percentage of gross revenue.

HHC Response: “The Auxiliary will request the Bellevue Hospital Center to revise the
contract with Cinemat. The revised contract should require the vendor to submit gross
revenue reports to the Auxiliary for verification and allow the Auxiliary to review the
vendors accounting records. The contract should also have a flat fee provision.”

HHC, the only entities authorized to have access to QA information are the New York State
Department of Health and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations

HHC officials did provide certain data that they said was comparable to QA data.
However, we were unable to verify whether the data provided to us was the same data that was
submitted to the Board. This and other relevant QA information that we were unable to review
could have provided us with insight into the reasons for the delays in HHC’s mammogram
services that we report and into any actions taken by HHC management to minimize those
delays. This information also might have enabled us to provide HHC management with more
detailed recommendations for reducing the noted delays.

The primary scope period covered by this audit was Fiscal Year 2009 (July 1, 2008,
through June 30, 2009).

To gain an understanding of HHC policies, procedures, and practices for mammogram
services, we interviewed HHC’s Senior Executive staff, including the Executive Vice
President/Corporate Chief Financial Officer, the Senior Vice President/Deputy Chief Medical
Officer, the Senior Assistant Vice President of Clinical Affairs, the Senior Assistant Vice
President of Community Health and Public Health Services, and the Chief Medical Informatics
Officer. In addition, we conducted walk-throughs at five HHC facilities, including the Belvis
Diagnostic and Treatment Center (Bronx), Coney","Coney Island Hospital (Brooklyn), Kings County
Hospital (Brooklyn), Metropolitan Hospital (Manhattan), and Queens Hospital (Queens). At
each of these facilities, we met with staff from the radiology and quality assurance departments,
as well as with representatives from each facility’s management information systems unit.

In addition, we reviewed the federal MQSA guidelines, which establish procedures for
facilities that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to perform screening and
diagnostic mammograms. We also reviewed the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging
Reporting and Database System (BI-RADS), which is a quality assurance guide designed to
standardize breast imaging reporting and facilitate outcome monitoring, as well as general
guidelines set forth by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and NCI. Finally, we reviewed the
written mammography policies and procedures for each HHC facility that performed
mammograms.

To determine whether HHC facilities schedule and conduct mammograms in a timely
manner, we reviewed HHC reports that showed the number of mammograms performed and the
waiting time for mammogram appointments at each HHC facility during Fiscal Year 2009. We
selected nine of the 16 facilities that performed mammograms and asked them to provide us with
the next available dates for mammogram appointments as of the dates of our visits to those

HHC, the only entities authorized to have access to QA information are the New York State
Department of Health and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
(JCAHO).

HHC officials did provide certain data that they said was comparable to QA data.
However, we were unable to verify whether the data provided to us was the same data that was
submitted to the Board. This and other relevant QA information that we were unable to review
could have provided us with insight into the reasons for the delays in HHC’s mammogram
services that we report and into any actions taken by HHC management to minimize those
delays. This information also might have enabled us to provide HHC management with more
detailed recommendations for reducing the noted delays.

The primary scope period covered by this audit was Fiscal Year 2009 (July 1, 2008,
through June 30, 2009).

To gain an understanding of HHC policies, procedures, and practices for mammogram
services, we interviewed HHC’s Senior Executive staff, including the Executive Vice
President/Corporate Chief Financial Officer, the Senior Vice President/Deputy Chief Medical
Officer, the Senior Assistant Vice President of Clinical Affairs, the Senior Assistant Vice
President of Community Health and Public Health Services, and the Chief Medical Informatics
Officer. In addition, we conducted walk-throughs at five HHC facilities, including the Belvis
Diagnostic and Treatment Center (Bronx), Coney Island Hospital (Brooklyn), Kings County
Hospital (Brooklyn","Brooklyn), Metropolitan Hospital (Manhattan), and Queens Hospital (Queens). At
each of these facilities, we met with staff from the radiology and quality assurance departments,
as well as with representatives from each facility’s management information systems unit.

In addition, we reviewed the federal MQSA guidelines, which establish procedures for
facilities that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to perform screening and
diagnostic mammograms. We also reviewed the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging
Reporting and Database System (BI-RADS), which is a quality assurance guide designed to
standardize breast imaging reporting and facilitate outcome monitoring, as well as general
guidelines set forth by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and NCI. Finally, we reviewed the
written mammography policies and procedures for each HHC facility that performed
mammograms.

To determine whether HHC facilities schedule and conduct mammograms in a timely
manner, we reviewed HHC reports that showed the number of mammograms performed and the
waiting time for mammogram appointments at each HHC facility during Fiscal Year 2009. We
selected nine of the 16 facilities that performed mammograms and asked them to provide us with
the next available dates for mammogram appointments as of the dates of our visits to those

whether order and exam dates on the lists were consistent with order and exam dates found in the
two systems. To determine whether mammogram results were read and communicated to
patients on a timely basis, we compared the dates of the 270 mammogram exams at the five
facilities to the dates that the radiologists read the results and the dates that the results were
communicated to the patients.

To determine whether interpreting radiologists had current licenses to practice medicine,
we obtained the names and titles of all the radiologists who interpreted mammography results in
Fiscal Year 2009 at the five facilities we visited. For each physician, we reviewed the online
license verification database of the New York State Education Department’s Office of
Professions.

To gain an understanding of how HHC calculated the percentage of women aged 40 to 70
who made a primary care or women’s health visit to an HHC facility and also received a
mammogram during the two-year period prior to the visit, we met with HHC’s Director of
Corporate Planning Services and the Chief Informatics Officer. We also reviewed
documentation, such as the HHC Monthly Corporate Dashboard Report, which provided certain
information on the calculation process. In addition, we reviewed the accuracy of the
programming language used to calculate this indicator in conjunction with a review of a
Quadramed list showing the patients (represented by number identifiers assigned for the audit)

for the long wait times, as follows:

Queens Hospital

On July 20, 2010, we met with officials at Queens Hospital to determine their wait time
for screening mammograms. Hospital officials provided documentation from their scheduling
unit that showed that the next available appointment was September 7, 2010, a total of 49
calendar days from the date of our visit. This was considerably more than HHC’s guideline of
14 days. Queens Hospital officials stated that due to many hospital closings in Queens, they are
often overwhelmed with patients seeking their services. According to HHC data, Queens
Hospital conducted the second largest number of mammograms (10,544) among HHC facilities
during Fiscal Year 2009. As such, Queens officials stated that they do not have adequate
capacity to accommodate patients and to meet HHC’s performance guideline. Furthermore,

Queens Hospital stated that budget cutbacks have also hindered their ability to provide screening
mammograms within HHC’s standard time frame.

Elmhurst Hospital

On August 26, 2010, we visited Elmhurst Hospital in Queens to determine their wait time
for screening mammogram appointments. Hospital officials provided documentation from their
scheduling unit that showed that the next available appointment was January",29091,4388
Comptroller_Reports/ME10_094A.pdf,1,Brooklyn,Brooklyn Health South,55.172413793103445,lemma,"visited Woodhull Hospital, which is located in Brooklyn.
Hospital officials provided documentation from their scheduling","in discussing the waiting time issue with Elmhurst Hospital officials,
the facility provided information showing the numbers of scheduled and completed
mammograms during the month of July 2010. The data indicated that there had been a high
number of no-shows. When we asked Elmhurst officials whether they contacted patients to
remind them of upcoming appointments, they stated that they did not. Other facilities that we
discussed this issue with stated that they do make reminder calls or send reminder letters. Such
calls or letters are very important considering the fact that a screening mammogram appointment
might be made weeks or months in advance. A study® available on the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) website reported that:

“Being too busy and forgetting to make or keep mammography appointments
were commonly reported and associated with annual-interval use. These barriers
have been among the most commonly-mentioned barriers since they were first

assessed. They underscore the importance of reminders in promoting regular
screening.”

Woodhull Hospital

On August 26, 2010, we visited Woodhull Hospital, which is located in Brooklyn","Brooklyn.
Hospital officials provided documentation from their scheduling unit that showed that the next
available appointment was October 6, 2010, a total of 41 calendar days from the date of our visit
and, 27 days beyond HHC’s 14-day standard. Woodhull officials attributed the long wait time
to several factors, including the loss of two full-time radiologists in December 2009 and January
2010, which led to the scheduling of fewer mammograms. In addition, officials cited an increase
in diagnostic exams because of its conversion from analog screening equipment to digital
screening equipment. Officials stated that the digital equipment identifies more potential
indicators of breast cancer than the analog equipment did. The officials claimed that this resulted
in a significant increase in diagnostic exams, which reduced the facility’s capacity to handle
routine screening mammograms. Furthermore, hospital officials stated that they have had to
reduce the number of Saturday appointments due to budget cuts.

The long waiting times at these three facilities may discourage women from following up
on their screening mammogram appointments. Women who have to wait a long time for their
appointments are more likely to miss their screenings. A study in the Journal of General
Internal Medicine found that women failed to keep about 25 percent of scheduled

mammograms.” The waiting interval for mammogram appointments was cited as an important
predictor of missed appointments, with long waiting times being associated with higher rates of
missed appointments. _HHC should perform a comprehensive review of its screening

2009","sample of drugs that had both a high unit cost and a high usage.
In order to do this, we determined the total value of each drug issued during the period June 1,
2009, to December 31, 2009. From this population, we judgmentally selected the eight drugs
each of which had a total usage value of more than $30,000. For these eight drugs, we traced the
corresponding 187 issuance entries, totaling $319,059, to the corresponding charge-out sheets
and request sheets.

We conducted two different tests on the adjustments. The first test was to determine
whether the adjustment entries made to OTPS were appropriate and had adequate supporting
documentation. We reviewed all 73 adjustment entries made to OTPS during November and
December 2009 (both the recording of free drugs and corrections to inventory balances) and
traced them to the corresponding supporting documentation.

For the second adjustment test, we obtained the monthly folders for July through
December 2009 maintained by the Purchasing Agent that contain written explanations and
supporting documentation for the 107 adjustments (corrections) that were made to OTPS’s
inventory balances. These 107 adjustments were recorded in OTPS as either issuance entries,
receipt entries, or adjustment entries. We reviewed this documentation to determine whether the
Purchasing Agent performed an investigation prior to making the adjustments and whether these
adjustments were approved by one of the Assistant Directors.

We reviewed prior audits conducted by the Comptroller's Office, Audit Report on
Inventory Controls over Non-Controlled Drugs at Coney","Coney Island Hospital issued on June 25,
2009 (Audit # MGO07-111A) and Audit Report on the Inventory Controls of Harlem Hospital
Center over Non-Controlled Drugs, issued May 3, 2006 (Audit # MHO5-130A) to determine
whether there were any recurring issues at the various facilities.

The results of the above tests, while not projected to their respective populations,
provided a reasonable basis for us to assess the adequacy of the inventory controls.

Discussion of Audit Results

The matters covered in this report were discussed with North Central Bronx Hospital
officials during and at the conclusion of this audit. A preliminary draft report was sent to HHC
officials and was discussed at an exit conference held on August 19, 2010. On August 27, 2010,
we submitted this draft report to HHC officials with a request for comments. We received a
written response from HHC officials on September 13, 2010. In their response, HHC officials
stated that they agreed with and have implemented all of the audit’s recommendations. The full
text of the HHC response is included as an addendum to this report.

* A charge-out sheet contains up to nine identifying stickers, which include a description of the drug, such
as the brand and generic names, strength, package size, quantity issued, quantity remaining on the self, and
the initials and date of the person who removed the drug from the shelf.

HHC Response: HHC agreed stating, “The facility’s account on the Returns Vendor’s
website is accessed to review the Credit Status Report. (This indicates estimated return

values from each company, date estimate was posted and quarterly payments posted).
This process is dependent on outside sources, i.e. drug manufactures for completeness
and accuracy.”

5. Maintain a record of the expired drugs kept in the stock room awaiting pick-up by
Guaranteed Returns.

HHC Response: HHC agreed to implement a compensating control stating, “Expired
medications have been moved to a secure location outside of the general stock storage
area, only accessible by supervisory staff. Pickup by the returns vendor is witnessed by
pharmacy staff and will continue as established procedure.”

Other Matters

Certain Employees Have Unnecessary Access to the
Pharmacy Department’s Inventory Records

During our review of employees who have access to the Pharmacy’s inventory records in
the OTPS system, we found four employees who are not responsible for overseeing the inventory
at the Pharmacy Department but have the authority to make entries to the inventory records The
four employees are a Network Associate Executive Director, an Assistant Director of Pharmacy
from Jacobi Hospital, and two employees from NCB’s Materials Management Department—a

Supervisor of Stock Workers and a Stock Worker. When employees who are not responsible for
managing","managing the inventory nevertheless have the ability to adjust the inventory records, the risk that
unauthorized changes will be made to the inventory records is increased. When we brought this
matter to the attention of the Assistant Director of the Pharmacy, he agreed that these employees
should not have this type of access. He stated that he has attempted to restrict access for these
individuals, but does not have the authority to make the change. He has requested this change
from the HHC Central Office, which does have the authority to make the change.

Recommendation

6. NCB Pharmacy officials and HHC officials should restrict access to the Pharmacy
Department inventory records to only those individuals authorized by the Pharmacy
Department.

HHC Response: HHC agreed to implement a compensating control stating, “The OTPS
system grants access privileges on security level, not department or location. As a result,
non-pharmacy employees have OTPS receiving functionality. As compensating controls
the pharmacy reviews receiving activity for possible unauthorized access.”

Dear Ms. Kim:
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the above referenced audit.

I was pleased to read that after a thorough review and verification of North Central Bronx
Hospital’s (NCBH) procedures, your audit found adequate internal controls existed over
NCBH’s non-controlled drugs. I also appreciate that the audit recognized the efforts set forth to
ensure that access to the Pharmacy Department was restricted and secured.

As the NCBH Pharmacy Department continues to make efforts to further strengthen operations,
we are in agreement with and have implemented all of the recommendations cited.

Enclosed please find the Audit Implementation Plan (Attachment I), which addresses all of the
recommendations cited.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background

The North Central Bronx Hospital (hospital), along with Jacobi Medical
Center, is part of the North Bronx Healthcare Network (Network), which is one of
the six regional health care networks of the New York City Health and Hospitals
Corporation (HHC). The North Central Bronx Auxiliary, Inc. (Auxiliary) is a
nonprofit organization that manages funds designated for services and programs that
enhance the quality of patient care at North Central Bronx Hospital. Both the
Network and the Auxiliary are required to follow the operating procedures
established by HHC to ensure that HHC facilities follow appropriate rules,
regulations, and procedures for collecting and using auxiliary funds. In addition, the
Auxiliary has its own bylaws.

The Auxiliary raises funds through donations, interest earned on Auxiliary
accounts, membership dues, and other revenue sources, including contracts with
concessionaires. These funds may be used for purchases deemed necessary for
patient-related care. The Auxiliary is also required to hold an annual fund-raising
event. According to its financial statements for calendar year 2000, the Auxiliary
earned $147,682 and expended a total of $124,844: $52,187 for Social",95,14

earned $147,682 and expended a total of $124,844: $52,187 for Social Services and
$72,657 for General and Administrative expenses.

Objectives

The objectives of this audit were to determine whether revenues and
expenses were accurately and fairly reported, whether the internal control
structure over the collection and disbursement of funds was adequate, and
whether expenses were in compliance with prescribed procedures, guidelines, and
bylaws.


## MG01_187A_page_4
Scope and Methodology

We reviewed the Auxiliary's books, records, and supporting documents for
calendar year 2000. We included calendar year 1999 and the first three quarters
of 2001 in our review of the Auxiliary's federal and state tax payments. We also
reviewed the Auxiliary's bylaws and Board meeting minutes for calendar years
1995 through 2001. In addition, we interviewed the personnel responsible for",898,134
Comptroller_Reports/MG01_187A.pdf,1,improper,improper billing practices,47.05882352941176,lemma,"to locate these assets.

The Auxiliary made improper and questionable expenditures (totaling
$3,262), and","taxes and made late payments of state withholding taxes for 1999,
2000, and the first three quarters of 2001. Furthermore, the Auxiliary
was late in filing related federal and state tax forms. Consequently, the
Auxiliary had to pay $7,705 in interest and penalties.

e Neither the Auxiliary nor the Network adequately monitored contracts
with concessionaires. Two vendors were operating under expired
contracts, one vendor was operating without a contract, and one
vendor had no contract on file. Moreover, there were no written

agreements with the vendors who sell merchandise in the hospital
lobbies.

e Of the 270 checks issued during 2000, only seven were signed by two
Board members, as required. The remaining 263 checks (97%) bore

## MG01_187A_page_5
only the signature-stamp of the Auxiliary President. Furthermore, all
three Auxiliary employees had unsupervised access to the signature
stamp.

Questionable payroll practices were employed, whereby employees’
payroll checks were prepared prior to review and approval of
employees’ time sheets. In addition, employees wrote their own
payroll checks and affixed the signature stamp to their payroll checks.

The Auxiliary did not adequately supervise its employees, and its
accounting and administrative functions were not segregated.

Errors existed in revenue ledger accounts; we were unable to trace the
expense account figures from the general ledger to the financial
statements because of inadequate documentation. Moreover, there was
no documentation to support the $199,845 of Fixed Assets reported in
the financial statements. We were unable to locate these assets.

The Auxiliary made improper","improper and questionable expenditures (totaling
$3,262), and 14 disbursements (totaling $3,027) were not approved by
the Board, as required.

The Auxiliary established a patient telephone program that consisted
of purchasing disposable telephones and selling them to patients.
However, there are no written procedures for this program and
controls over the distribution of the telephones were inadequate.

This audit makes 20 recommendations, some of which are listed below.
The Auxiliary Board of Directors and North Bronx Healthcare Network should:

Ensure that monthly deposits of federal withholding taxes are made in
a timely manner.

Ensure that federal form 941 and state form NYS-45 are filed on time,
and that withholding taxes are paid in a timely manner.

Monitor contracts to ensure that the bidding or renewal process is
initiated well before each contract's expiration date.

Enter into signed agreements with vendors that sell merchandise in the
hospital's lobby areas.

Ensure that all checks bear the two required signatures.

Ensure that all time sheets are approved and signed before payroll
checks are prepared.

INTRODUCTION

Background

The North Central Bronx Hospital (hospital), along with Jacobi Medical Center, is part of
the North Bronx Healthcare Network (Network), which is one of the six regional health care
networks of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC). The North Central
Bronx Auxiliary, Inc. (Auxiliary) is a nonprofit organization that manages","manages funds designated for
services and programs that enhance the quality of patient care at North Central Bronx Hospital.
Both the Network and the Auxiliary are required to follow the operating procedures established by
HHC to ensure that HHC facilities follow appropriate rules, regulations, and procedures for
collecting and using auxiliary funds. In addition, the Auxiliary has its own bylaws.

The Auxiliary raises funds through donations, interest earned on Auxiliary accounts,
membership dues, and other revenue sources, including contracts with concessionaires.' These
funds may be used for purchases deemed necessary for patient-related care. The Auxiliary is also
required to hold an annual fund-raising event.

According to its financial statements for 2000, the Auxiliary earned $147,682 and expended
a total of $124,844: $52,187 for Social Services and $72,657 for General and Administrative
expenses.

A four-member Board of Directors governs the Auxiliary: the President, who serves as the
chairman of the Board; the Vice President; the treasurer, and the secretary. The Auxiliary has ten
members, as well as a Network liaison to the Auxiliary who is responsible for advising the

e The Auxiliary made improper and questionable expenditures (totaling $3,262) and","s operating
procedures. There are weaknesses in internal controls relating to oversight and monitoring
functions, segregation of duties, accountability, and record-keeping. Specifically:

The Auxiliary did not make monthly deposits of federal withholding taxes and made
late payments of state withholding taxes for 1999, 2000, and the first three quarters of
2001. Furthermore, the Auxiliary was late in filing related federal and state tax
forms. Consequently, the Auxiliary had to pay $7,705 in interest and penalties.

Neither the Auxiliary nor the Network adequately monitored contracts with
concessionaires. Two vendors were operating under expired contracts, one vendor
was operating without a contract, and one vendor had no contract on file. Moreover,

disbursements (totaling $3,027) were not approved by the Board, as required.

e The Auxiliary established a patient telephone program that consisted of purchasing
disposable telephones, and selling them to patients. However, there are no written
procedures for this program and controls over the distribution of the telephones were
inadequate.

These issues are discussed in detail in the following sections of this report:

The Auxiliary Violates Federal and State Tax Regulations

The Auxiliary violated federal and state tax regulations. It did not make monthly
deposits of federal taxes withheld for 1999, 2000, and the first three quarters of 2001, as required
by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, the Auxiliary was late in filing Federal Form 9417.
The Auxiliary was also late in filing NYS-45° and making payments of taxes withheld for 1999,
2000, and the first three quarters of 2001. As a result, the Auxiliary paid a total of $7,705 in
interest and penalties to federal and state authorities.

According to the Internal Revenue Service Instruction for Form 941: “Employers who
withhold income tax wages, or who must pay social security or Medicare tax, must file form 941
each calendar quarter.” However, in 2000, if the tax liability for the quarter was $1,000 or more
(increased to $2,500 for 2001), employers were required to make monthly deposits and then file
form 941 each quarter with no payment. Publication 15 Circular E, Employer’s Tax Guide,
states: “For",17194,2605

at the","There is now reliable personnel performing the
accounting functions for the Auxiliary. As a result, all taxes are being filed on a timely
basis.”

Inadequate Oversight and Enforcement of Concession Contracts

There was inadequate oversight and enforcement of contracts with the four
concessionaires operating in the hospital. The vending machine company and the coffee shop
were operating under expired contracts; the flower vending machine company was operating
without a contract; and there was no copy of the contract between HHC and the television rental

merchandise in its lobbies.

In calendar year 2000, the concessionaires, who made total payments of $111,077 to the
Auxiliary, either had no contract on file or operated under expired contracts. The vending
machine company’s contract had expired in March 1993, and the coffee shop’s contract had
expired in May 1994. In the case of the coffee shop, we received only a portion of the contract
that expired in 1993, which lacked the signatures of the parties involved. An accompanying
letter extended the contract until May 1994.

HHC’s Operating Procedures 10-16 states that it is the Network's responsibility to ensure
that all vendors are operating under valid concession contracts and that the Network and
Auxiliary must maintain copies of these contracts. Both the Network and the Auxiliary have
been negligent in following HHC's operating procedures regarding concession contracts.

The Auxiliary received an additional $18,752 in fees","fees from vendors who sell merchandise
at the hospital. Those vendors operate under the Lobby Vendor Program, but there are no
written agreements that stipulate how the program should operate or how much each vendor
should pay. The Auxiliary receives fees from the vendors informally.

All commission payments, except those from the coffee shop, are submitted to the
Network's Finance Department, at Jacobi Hospital, which in turn submits the checks to the
Auxiliary for deposit. The coffee shop submits its checks directly to the Auxiliary. Based on our
review of the two expired contracts (the only ones available), commission payments from the
concessions were due no later than the 15'"" day of each month.

Neither the Network Finance Department nor the Auxiliary date-stamped the checks
upon receipt. Therefore, we were unable to determine if commission checks from vendors were

received on time, or how long it took the Auxiliary to deposit checks. We compared the date on
the checks to the date of the deposits and found time lags of up to 83 days between the check
dates and the deposit dates.

Comptroller's Directive #11 - Cash Accountability and Control, states: “Since cash is the
asset most susceptible to misappropriation, agencies must exercise utmost care when handling
cash.” Directive #11 also states that: “deposits must be made on a daily basis.” Since the checks
were not date-stamped upon receipt, we cannot definitely state who is at fault for the late deposit

HHC Response: “Since July 2001, all vendors that sell merchandise in the hospital lobby
have signed agreements with the hospital.”

6. Ensure that commission payments from all vendors are accurate and are received
within the time frame stipulated in contracts.

HHC_ Response: “The office manager of the Auxiliary monitors the commission
payments from all vendors. On a monthly basis the Department of Internal Audits
performs a review of this process.”


## MG01_187A_page_18
7. Ensure that original and copies of contracts are maintained and kept in a secure place.

HHC_ Response: “When the Hospital Business Office has completed any contract
negotiations a copy will be maintained in the Business Office as well as the Auxiliary.”

8. Ensure that commission checks are date-stamped when they are received and that all
cash received (i.e., checks) is deposited on a daily basis.

HHC Response: “The Auxiliary Office Manager date stamps all commission checks.
Cash is deposited on the day received and checks are deposited on a weekly basis due to
low volume.

Internal Control Weaknesses

Weaknesses in the Auxiliary’s internal controls reduced accountability and supervision
and may have affected the accuracy of the Auxiliary’s records. Specifically, the Auxiliary:

e Used a signature stamp in place of the required two signatures for checks;

e Did not approve time sheets prior to writing and signature-stamping payroll checks;
e Had inadequate supervision and lack of segregation of duties;

e Did not properly record all financial transactions;

e Made improper","improper and questionable expenditures; and

e Had inadequate inventory controls over patient telephones.

Internal controls are designed to encourage adherence to managerial policies. Such
controls consist of procedures an agency uses to safeguard resources; provide accurate
information; and assure adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and policies. Controls include
adequate segregation of duties, ongoing reviews and monitoring functions, and adequate security
over assets.

A Signature Stamp Was Used on Checks Issued
Instead of the Required Two Signatures

According to a signed agreement between the Auxiliary and the bank, two signatures are
required for all checks; the Auxiliary President, Vice-President, Treasurer, and Secretary are the
authorized signatories. However, a stamp of the Auxiliary’s President signature was used as the
only signature for 263 (97%) of the checks written in 2000. Furthermore, three Auxiliary
employees had unsupervised access to the signature stamp.

The signature stamp and checks were kept in a safe to which all three employees had
access, and they were used by all employees. For example, the office manager, who performs
most of the steps in the purchasing process, prepares the checks and stamps signatures on them
to pay for purchases. Although most expenditures are approved by the Board, there is no
supervision or monitoring of checks issued.

“ongoing monitoring reduces the risk of improper","improper actions and misappropriation. . . .” The
Auxiliary Board of Directors should ensure that all checks have the required two signatures on
them.

We interviewed the President and other members of the Auxiliary Board to find out if
there was any Board supervision over the use of the signature stamp. They did not recall a
discussion or approval by the Board regarding this matter, nor did any of the minutes we
reviewed for 1998, 1999, and 2000 address this issue. In October 2001, we requested written
documentation from the Auxiliary indicating that the Board had approved the use of the
signature stamp. We did not receive documentation. Instead we received a memorandum, dated
November 15, 2001, from the Director of Internal Audits of the North Bronx Healthcare
Network stating, “The President of the Auxiliary authorized the usage of the signature stamp.”

According to HHC’s procedure 10-20, and the Auxiliary’s bylaws, the President
performs all duties incidental to the office and has such powers and duties as may be assigned by
the Auxiliary and the hospital’s chief executive officer. Therefore, decisions on use of the
signature stamp should have been discussed and approved by board members and the Network’s
official liaison to the Auxiliary, and should have been documented.

Payroll Checks Were Issued Before
Time Sheets Were Signed and Approved

Auxiliary’s officials do not have adequate internal controls over payroll and personnel
management practices. They did not ensure that the responsibilities for timekeeping, payroll
processing, and supervision were",31898,5001
Comptroller_Reports/MG01_187A.pdf,1,managing,Managed Care Organization,42.42424242424242,lemma,"and the Auxiliary would be responsible for managing
it. We requested any written procedures for","of the telephones and there is no written procedures for the operation
of this program.

We reviewed all purchases and sales of telephones for 2000, and January to September
2001. In 2000, the Auxiliary purchased 1,300 disposable telephones, costing $8,025, and sold
759 to patients for a total of $12,377. Neither the Auxiliary nor the hospital maintained inventory
records of the telephones on hand. Nor were records kept of the free telephones given to needy
or isolated patients, or as courtesies. Therefore, we could not determine how many telephones
should have been in stock.

The supervisor of the Telecommunication department told us that she did not know how
the program worked. She referred us to the Telecommunication Technician, who receives and
installs the telephones. The technician told us that he installed the telephones based on a cashier's
listing of patients who paid for telephones and the rooms they were in. He said he also installed
free telephones based on requests from the hospital patient relations department. No inventory
records were maintained by the technician, who had sole responsibility for the storage and
distribution of the telephones.

The Auxiliary Board meeting minutes for April 29, 1997, state that “the Auxiliary would
fund these telephones and would then receive the funds that the hospital collected for the
phones.” There was no indication in the minutes that the Board discussed how the program was
going to operate or who from the hospital and the Auxiliary would be responsible for managing","managing
it. We requested any written procedures for the program but were unable to obtain any.

Without adequate controls over the telephones, there is a possibility that thefts may go
unnoticed. The Auxiliary should prepare written procedures identifying the role of persons
responsible for the program and require an inventory system that accounts for the receipts and
disbursements of the telephones.

Recommendations

The Auxiliary Board and North Bronx Healthcare Network should:
9. Ensure that all checks bear the two required signatures.

HHC Response: “Rather than the two signature requirement, Auxiliary officials will sign
checks on a rotating basis. In addition, all requisitions and purchase orders will be signed
by a Hospital senior administrator and an Auxiliary member. All purchases or
expenditures over $300 will be reviewed by the Auxiliary Board and documented in the
minutes.”

10. Ensure that all time sheets are approved and signed before payroll checks are
prepared.

HHC Response: “The one remaining Auxiliary employee has his time sheet approved by
the Site Administrator on a weekly basis.”

16


## MG01_187A_page_25
11. Develop procedures relating to employees’ working hours, compensation, vacation
and sick days, etc. Once established, these procedures should be documented.

HHC Response: “A policy on employee compensation has been developed and
documented for the NCB Auxiliary.”

12. Ensure that there is adequate supervision of Auxiliary staff members who perform the
office, bookkeeping, and accounting functions. This includes appropriately
documenting its review of the staffs work.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background

The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) provides
City residents with comprehensive medical and mental health services, as well as
treatment for substance abuse, regardless of ability to pay. HHC hospitals,
clinics, and other facilities require substantial quantities of drugs and medical and
surgical supplies, and must ensure that items are in stock when needed. HHC has
a computerized OTPS (Other Than Personal Services) procurement management
system that stores perpetual inventory records. Each facility has access to the
system, to maintain and update its records as necessary. This system, based on
minimum and maximum quantities, includes a reorder point for each item at each
facility, and automatically generates a purchase requisition when the reorder point
is reached.

Network (Network). Woodhull Hospital officials do not fully utilize the OTPS
system: inventory shipments to Woodhull Hospital are recorded in the OTPS
system, but inventory issued from the hospital’s own stockrooms is not recorded
in the system. Both the Pharmacy and Material Management Departments keep
only manual inventory records.

Drugs are categorized into two groups: controlled and non-controlled.
Controlled drugs are regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), a
federal law-enforcement agency that has strict requirements for the storage,

record keeping, and dispensing of controlled drugs. The DEA, however, does not
regulate non-controlled drugs. This audit reviews the inventory controls put in
place by HHC and Woodhull Hospital over non-controlled drugs, as well as over
medical and surgical supplies.

During Fiscal Year 2001, the total cost of drugs (controlled and non-
controlled) purchased by the Pharmacy Department was approximately $6
million. The total for medical and surgical supplies purchased by Material
Management was about $3 million. According to Woodhull Hospital officials,
the value of the inventory of all drugs in the Pharmacy Department stockroom at
the end of Fiscal Year 2001 was $1,015,590, and the value of the medical and
surgical supplies in the Material Management stockrooms was $1,212,319.

The Pharmacy stockroom receives orders for non-controlled drugs from
the subdivisions of the Pharmacy Department: Main Pharmacy, inpatient satellite
pharmacy, and Out-Patient Pharmacy (OPD).

Material Management stores medical and surgical supplies (intravenous

with a request for comments. We received a written response from HHC officials

on June 20, 2002, which included a memorandum from Woodhull Hospital’s

staff. In its response, HHC said that it agreed with and will implement eight of

the audit’s ten recommendations. HHC said, however, that it would not
implement the two recommendations regarding the posting and monitoring of

inventories on manual stock cards, since Woodhull Hospital would soon maintain

computerized inventory records. The President of HHC stated, in part:

report.

“We agree a computerized perpetual inventory system would be an
improvement from our current manual process. . . . To expedite the
facility’s conversion from a manual inventory system to a
computerized perpetual inventory, the inventory process will begin
on June 20, 2002... . Consequently, the implementation of
recommendations two and three regarding the posting and
monitoring of inventories on manual stock cards will not be
necessary. The Materials Management Department is expected to
complete the conversion to a computerized perpetual system,
including the training of personnel and appropriate segregation of
responsibilities by August 2002 and the Pharmacy Department by
November 2002.”

11 acute-care hospitals; four long-term care facilities; six diagnostic and treatment centers; one

HHC hospitals, clinics, and other facilities require substantial quantities of drugs and
medical and surgical supplies, and must ensure that items are in stock when needed. HHC has a
computerized OTPS (Other Than Personal Services) procurement management system that stores
perpetual inventory records. Each facility has access to the system, to maintain and update its
records as necessary. This system, based on minimum and maximum quantities, includes a
reorder point for each item at each facility,’ and automatically generates a purchase requisition
when the reorder point is reached. The requisitions are printed out at each facility’s Pharmacy
Department or Material Management Department—the entities that order and maintain
inventories of drugs and medical and surgical supplies. HHC requires that each facility perform
a physical inventory at the end of each fiscal year.

by this audit, is part of the HHC’s North Brooklyn","Brooklyn Health Network (Network). Woodhull

FINANCIAL AUDIT

Audit Report on the Financial and Operating Practices
of the Children of Bellevue, Inc.

FP19-100A
|
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Children of Bellevue, Inc. (CoB) is a non-profit organization established to provide funding
and develop programs that benefit children who are patients at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue
(H+H) (Bellevue). Per its mission, CoB is responsible for the initiation, funding, and development
of various programs at Bellevue that enhance the patient care of children admitted to the hospital.

As stipulated in its by-laws, CoB’s day-to-day operations are overseen by a Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors is further broken down into various subcommittees which provide guidance
in specific areas of CoB’s operations. Current subcommittees include the Executive, Audit,
Finance, Governance, Development and Marketing, Program, and Toast Committees.

For Calendar Year 2018, CoB reported a total income of $1,230,608 and reported total expenses
of $1,406,027. Thus, CoB incurred a net loss of $175,419 in Calendar Year 2018.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

Although CoB generally maintained adequate controls over its operations, we found several
weaknesses in CoB’s internal control structure. Specifically, we found that CoB did not establish
adequate written policies and procedures for employees on the proper way to manage","manage all of the
day-to-day fiscal activities of the organization. In addition to the lack of organizational policies and
procedures, we found that H+H did not update its Operating Procedure 10-20 (OP 10-20), a
procedure established to govern the operations of H+H’s auxiliaries; consequently, H+H officials
stated that the OP 10-20 was outdated and no longer enforced. Thus, CoB operated without being
held to any current H+H policy and oversight requirements. Consequently, we identified
deficiencies within the organization’s revenue collection and recording practices. We also found
that CoB did not consistently execute written agreements with its independent contractors. As a
result, CoB incurred a relatively significant amount of expenses without a central agreement to
document essential agreed-upon terms, such as price, period, scope of work, and other critical
information.

We also found that CoB did not maintain accurate and consistent books and records for its
donations across its multiple accounting systems. Specifically, we found discrepancies in the
recorded donation information in its DonorPerfect and QuickBooks accounting systems. In

addition to the inconsistently reported information, CoB’s accounting practices did not include a
practical means of identifying transactions across its multiple accounting systems.

Audit Recommendations
CoB’s Board of Directors should:

1. Establish additional written policies and procedures that include detailed guidance
to its employees on the day-to-day fiscal activities of the organization. Specifically,
written",6514,853
Comptroller_Reports/FP19_100A.pdf,1,manage,Managed Care Organization,38.70967741935484,lemma,"CoB employees on the proper
way to manage all of the day-to-day fiscal","did not enforce or update its Operating Procedure 10-20 (OP 10-20), a 2010
procedure governing the operations of Auxiliaries of H+H.

We also found that CoB did not maintain accurate and consistent books and records for the
donations reported across its multiple accounting systems. Moreover, CoB’s accounting practices
related to donations did not include a reasonable means of identifying transactions across
accounting systems and records. In addition, CoB did not consistently execute written agreements
with its independent contractors. Furthermore, we were unable to verify whether CoB’s revenues
and expenses were accurately reported on its financial statements because the audited financial
statements for Calendar Year 2018 have not been issued as of the date of this report.®

Inadequate Written Policies and Procedures

CoB and its Board of Directors did not maintain adequate written internal policies and procedures
to govern its operations, ensure accurate reporting of revenues and expenditures, and establish
proper controls. According to the Office of the New York State Attorney General's (NYSAG)
Internal Controls and Financial Accountability for Not-For-Profit Boards, “Every organization
should have procedures to monitor and keep records of assets received, held and expended.
These financial controls should be described in a written document.”

Our review of CoB’s records found that the organization and its Board of Directors did not
establish sufficient controls to govern its operations. Specifically, CoB has not established
adequate written policies and procedures to provide guidance to CoB employees on the proper
way to manage","manage all of the day-to-day fiscal activities of the organization. Upon questioning the lack
of written policies and procedures available, CoB provided some written policies applicable to
areas such as online purchases, bank deposit reconciliation, credit card purchases, and invoice
payment. However, we found that these policies were insufficient to manage several critical areas
of CoB’s operations. Specifically, there was no written guidance pertaining to the receipt of
donations, review of data entries, and use of independent contractors.

In addition to CoB’s lack of adequate internal policies and procedures, we note that H+H did not
update its policies to enable it to appropriately oversee its Auxiliaries. According to H+H officials,
OP 10-20, issued in November 2010, was outdated and thus no longer enforced by H+H. As a
result, during our audit scope period, H+H was not enforcing any oversight policy applicable to
the Auxiliaries.

A new version was posted to H+H’s intranet in February 2019; however, the new version was still
in draft and was not applicable to our 2018 audit scope period. Further, a comparison of both
versions of the operating procedures shows that the newly drafted version has even fewer
reporting requirements for the Auxiliaries than the previous one. For instance, the applicable 2010
OP 10-20 required that, at a minimum, CoB prepare and submit a quarterly financial statement of

the firm’s poor service, H+H decided to engage another CPA firm to conduct the audits of the Calendar Year 2018 financial statements.

review, reconciliation, and entry into QuickBooks.

The majority (99.8% of total 2018 donations, by dollar value) of CoB’s donations received are not physical
cash, and therefore, the risk of misappropriation is low. Cash donations received at small fundraising events
are counted by three individuals and placed in a sealed, signed envelope with the total amount and count of
each denomination listed. The sealed envelope is brought to Children of Bellevue’s office the following
business day, and the cash is counted again by the Directors of Development and Administration. The
donation is then entered into DonorPerfect, and the cash is taken the same day to the bank.

Response to Recommendation 1c

Children of Bellevue’s Board will establish a written policy and procedure that dictates when to receive a
purchase order or invoice and when to enter into a written contract with an independent contractor or
vendor based on the dollar amount of the expense and the duration of services provided. Children of
Bellevue already has existing contracts with some individuals who provide services, for example, with an
event planning company and a child abuse pediatrician. The largest contracted work referenced by the City
Comptroller’s office was with New York City Health + Hospitals/Bellevue, and it constituted 70 percent of the
total expense. Children of Bellevue believes that a contract with each of these individuals was not necessary
because they were Bellevue employees who were not managed","managed or overseen by Children of Bellevue but
rather by their department heads at the hospital. Children of Bellevue helped the hospital fund these
individuals’ salaries and wages because they provide services for children and families that as a public
hospital, Bellevue would otherwise be unable to afford.

The written policy and procedure will be ratified by the Board of Directors at the September 2020 regular
meeting. The written policy and procedure for independent contractors and vendors will be reviewed by the
Governance Committee of the Board of Directors every three years. Agreements entered into with
independent contractors and vendors will include contractor information, agreement term period, pricing
agreed to, frequency and method of payment, description of services to be rendered, deliverables to be
produced, performance expectations, and frequency of contractor performance and agreement review.
Purchase orders, invoices, and written agreements are currently and will continue to be maintained by the
Director of Administration. Any new purchase orders and invoices are currently and will continue to be
reviewed weekly by the designated Board Member on the Finance Committee.

Response to Recommendation 1d

Written agreements with independent contractors will be reviewed by the Governance Committee of the
Board of Directors before being executed. Ongoing agreements with independent contractors will be
reviewed by the Governance Committee at the end of the service period or every three years, whichever is
earlier. The Governance Committee will undertake to review all existing agreements with independent
contractors prior to October 2020.

Response to Recommendation 2

reconciliation report to verify that the transactions are consistently recorded across both systems.

Response to Recommendation 5

As detailed above in our responses to recommendations 3 and 4, Children of Bellevue currently verifies that
all financial and operational information reported to both the Board of Directors and NYC Health + Hospitals/
Bellevue is accurate. The Director of Development reviews donations daily and then again monthly and
quarterly. The Director of Administration reconciles income and expenses weekly and then monthly. The
Bookkeeper reconciles income and expenses monthly and reconciles the two systems quarterly with support
from the Directors of Administration and Development.

AUDIT REPORT IN BRIEF

On January, 19, 1996, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the President of the New York City
Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
setting forth the terms and conditions for the transfer of Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
from HHC to the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). The transfer of responsibilities
sought to improve the effectiveness of ambulance and pre-hospital emergency medical services
by combining EMS personnel with the FDNY emergency response system.

The MOU specifies that HHC will bill and receive all amounts arising from EMS’s
delivery of patients to HHC hospitals pending FDNY’s assumption of the billing and collection",3132,371

AUDIT REPORT IN BRIEF

On January, 19, 1996, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the President of the New York City
Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
setting forth the terms and conditions for the transfer of Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
from HHC to the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). The transfer of responsibilities
sought to improve the effectiveness of ambulance and pre-hospital emergency medical services
by combining EMS personnel with the FDNY emergency response system.

The MOU specifies that HHC will bill and receive all amounts arising from EMS’s
delivery of patients to HHC hospitals pending FDNY’s assumption of the billing and collection
responsibilities itself. The MOU requires the City Budget Director and President of HHC jointly
to project the amount of EMS-anticipated collections (projected collections) prior to each fiscal
year. The amount of projected collections must be repaid to the City by HHC in four payments,
three at the end of each of the first three quarters, and one final payment within 60 days of the
end of the City’s fiscal year. The final payment may require adjustment based on differences
between actual and projected collections and from adjustments or expenses incurred or paid by
HHC on behalf of EMS.

In 2002, FDNY assumed responsibility for billing and collection of non-Medicaid","Medicaid
payments—third-party insurance, self-pay patients, and Medicare—for EMS services provided
to patients delivered to HHC hospitals. Currently, those payments are sent to a lockbox and
transferred daily to an HHC bank account. HHC remits these amounts, less any HHC
deductions, as part of its quarterly payments to the City.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

HHC did not adhere to the financial terms of the MOU. Since 2000, HHC improperly
deducted $2,450,578 in offsets against EMS payments due the City. These offsets include
$1,454,638 for use of space to operate the fleet maintenance facility at Sea View, even though an
agreement exists between the City and HHC for use of the premises; $947,447 in bank charges

for its own lockbox account; and $48,493 in unsubstantiated payments to vendors. Furthermore,
HHC and the City did not negotiate a payment schedule once FDNY assumed the responsibilities
of billing and collecting of non-Medicaid revenue. As a result, there has been an unwarranted
delay in payments by HHC to the City of non-Medicaid revenue. In addition, HHC did not
obtain prior written approval from the City when it delayed making quarterly Medicaid payments
in 2006. Finally, FDNY made untimely rental payments for a radio transmittal tower resulting in
$5,052 in unnecessary late fees for Fiscal Year 2008.

and better coordination. Although",5923,733

The City could have prevented these issues through closer oversight, enhanced controls,

HHC, the City is at risk of losing potential interest income until the parties establish new due
dates and associated late payment penalties.

Audit Recommendations

We make seven recommendations to HHC that it should:

e Pay the City $2,450,578.

Abide by the terms of the July 20, 2000 license agreement and cease assessing the
City an indirect cost associated with the City’s use of Sea View Hospital and
surrounding area.

Cease charging the City bank fees associated with HHC’s lockbox account.

Maintain supporting documentation for any adjustments or credits against the
payments made to the City.

end of the City’s fiscal year. The final payment may require adjustment based on differences
between actual and projected collections and from adjustments or expenses incurred or paid by
HHC on behalf of EMS.

In 2002, FDNY assumed responsibility for billing and collection of non-Medicaid
payments—third-party insurance, self-pay patients, and Medicare—for EMS services provided
to patients delivered to HHC hospitals. Currently, those payments are sent to a lockbox and
transferred daily to an HHC bank account. HHC remits these amounts, less any HHC
deductions, as part of its quarterly payments to the City.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

HHC did not adhere to the financial terms of the MOU. Since 2000, HHC improperly
deducted $2,450,578 in offsets against EMS payments due the City. These offsets include
$1,454,638 for use of space to operate the fleet maintenance facility at Sea View, even though an
agreement exists between the City and HHC for use of the premises; $947,447 in bank charges

HHC and the City did not negotiate a payment schedule once FDNY assumed the responsibilities
of billing and collecting of non-Medicaid revenue. As a result, there has been an unwarranted
delay in payments by HHC to the City of non-Medicaid","Medicaid revenue. In addition, HHC did not
obtain prior written approval from the City when it delayed making quarterly Medicaid payments
in 2006. Finally, FDNY made untimely rental payments for a radio transmittal tower resulting in
$5,052 in unnecessary late fees for Fiscal Year 2008.

The City could have prevented these issues through closer oversight, enhanced controls,
and better coordination. Although the City may be able to recoup the improper deductions from
HHC, the City is at risk of losing potential interest income until the parties establish new due
dates and associated late payment penalties.

to patients delivered to HHC hospitals. Currently, those payments are sent to a lockbox and
transferred daily to an HHC bank account. HHC remits these amounts, less any HHC deductions
(as noted in Table I), as part of its quarterly payments to the City.

The amount of Medicaid collections allocable to EMS are calculated by HHC using a
formula established by New York State (State) that computes the EMS component of a total
inpatient payment made by the State to HHC hospitals, regardless of the method of transport
(delivery) to the hospital. The Medicaid formula uses a series of variables based on the actual
hospital, duration of stay, and diagnosis. HHC includes a projected Medicaid collection amount
due EMS as part of its quarterly payments to the City.

The MOU also provided that FDNY would have the use of certain HHC property to carry
out emergency services. As a result of the transfer, the City and HHC identified all leases used
primarily by EMS and determined the appropriate treatment of each. During Fiscal Years 2006
through 2008, lease and license payments for two EMS stations and two radio transmittal towers
were processed through HHC’s Other Than Personnel Services (OTPS) accounts-payable system
by FDNY personnel.’ These payments, totaling approximately $600,000 per year, were
deducted by HHC when calculating its final payment due the City. Also, refunds issued to

sought to improve the effectiveness of ambulance and pre-hospital emergency medical services
by combining EMS personnel with the FDNY emergency response system. In March 1996,
EMS was established as a separate bureau within FDNY.

The MOU specifies that HHC will bill and receive all amounts arising from EMS’s
delivery of patients to HHC hospitals pending FDNY’s assumption of the billing and collection
responsibilities itself. The MOU requires the City Budget Director and President of HHC jointly
to project the amount of EMS-anticipated collections (projected collections) prior to each fiscal
year. The amount of projected collections must be repaid to the City by HHC in four payments,
three at the end of each of the first three quarters, and one final payment within 60 days of the
end of the City’s fiscal year. The final payment may require adjustment based on differences
between actual and projected collections and from adjustments or expenses incurred or paid by
HHC on behalf of EMS.

To determine whether the fees HHC deducted against EMS collections for licenses and
leases were appropriate, we obtained the amounts that should have been deducted as indicated on
the leases and license agreements, and reconciled those amounts to the fees deducted on the EMS
Settlement Worksheet. To assess the validity of those deductions, we conducted observations of
each site to ascertain whether they were used for only EMS activities. We also conducted an
observation of the Goldwater Hospital’s pharmacy to determine whether a pharmacist was

was discussed at an exit conference held on May 15, 2009. On August 24, 2009, we submitted a

written responses from FDNY on September 1, 2009, from OMB on September 11, 2009, and
from HHC on September 15, 2009.

In their response, HHC officials stated “HHC acknowledges your findings concerning the
Sea View rental payments of $1,454,638 and lack of documentation for vendor payments of
$48,493.” They further stated that HHC reimbursed the City $1,503,131 of the $2,450,578

HHC did not adhere to the financial terms of the MOU. Since 2000, HHC improperly
deducted $2,450,578 in offsets against EMS payments due the City. These offsets include
$1,454,638 for use of space to operate the fleet maintenance facility at Sea View, even though an

HHC and the City did not negotiate a payment schedule once FDNY assumed the responsibilities
of billing and collecting of non-Medicaid revenue. As a result, there has been an unwarranted
delay in payments by HHC to the City of non-Medicaid revenue. In addition, HHC did not
obtain prior written approval from the City when it delayed making quarterly Medicaid payments
in 2006. Finally, FDNY made untimely rental payments for a radio transmittal tower resulting in
$5,052 in unnecessary late fees","fees for Fiscal Year 2008.

$48,493 in Unsubstantiated Expenses Results in
Underpayment to the City

HHC inappropriately charged the City for certain EMS vendor payments on the EMS
Settlement Worksheet by $48,493 from Fiscal Year 2006 through 2008. Subsequently, HHC
deducted those amounts from its final payment to the City and indicated the adjustment on the
EMS Settlement Worksheet. In reviewing these payments, we found no documentation to
support the $48,493 charge to the City, and therefore conclude that the City should not accept
these as offsets to revenue due the City from HHC.

Payments made to specific vendors are identified on HHC’s OTPS check register, and
each payment has corresponding invoices and/or agreements on file. In addition, vendor names
were entered into HHC’s OTPS accounts-payable system and assigned a unique vendor code.
However, the $48,493 in payments that lacked supporting documentation were processed under a
miscellaneous code. Miscellaneous coding is also used to process refunds. Therefore, these two
types of payments cannot be differentiated. (See Table III for a breakdown.)

We requested HHC to provide supporting documentation to justify these OTPS
payments, but they were unable to do so. Since we could not determine the services received, we
question the validity of these charges.

HHC Response: “HHC disagrees with the finding that supporting documentation was not
supplied and that there are ‘unsubstantiated’ expenses. The differences totaling $48,493
in the draft report relate to EMS-generated patient refund checks that were subsequently
cancelled or became stale dated. HHC did subsequently provide to the auditors IT-
generated reports supporting these amounts.

“However, we do agree HHC underpaid the City by $48,493 for fiscal 2006 through
2008. EMS patient refunds, net of stale-dated/cancelled checks, appropriately reduces
the collections credited to EMS in the settlement calculation. Patient refunds in the OTPS
system are not reduced by stale-dated cancelled checks. The resulting difference was
inadvertently included in the settlement calculation as OTPS expenditures incurred by
EMS. OTPS expenditures incurred by EMS should only be the EMS lease payments and
only these amounts will be included from now on.

“HHC has always maintained supporting details and will continue to do so for refund
checks issued as well as stale dated/ cancelled checks, which appropriately reduce the
patient refunds used in the settlement reconciliation. The OTPS deductions used in the
settlement should reflect only those for lease and rental payments paid through the HHC
OTPS system on behalf of FDNY/EMS. This has been corrected with the 6/30/09
settlement reconciliation.”

Auditor Comment: On several occasions, we asked HHC officials to provide
documentation to support the $48,493 in overstatements. While HHC did subsequently
provide documentation purporting to justify the overstatements, the amounts in the IT-
generated reports did not correlate to the $48,493 in overstatements. Therefore, these
differences remain unsubstantiated.

Untimely Payment for EMS Services

HHC does not pay the City within a reasonable time frame for the cost of EMS services.
Since 2002, HHC has continuously delayed making timely payments to the City because it has
followed an outdated practice of making quarterly payments based on projections of future non-
Medicaid collections. This process was established when HHC was billing and collecting EMS
payments. However, once FDNY assumed the responsibility for billing functions, the projected
collection and quarterly payment process for non-Medicaid revenue should have ceased and
payment remitted much sooner than every three months.

Although the MOU no longer requires projected collections and quarterly payments
because FDNY performs the billing and collecting functions itself, the MOU did not specify the",33919,5349

frequency with which the City should receive payment. There is no basis for HHC to hold
these payments for this length of time. Accordingly, HHC should pay the City at least no later
than within 30 days from the date HHC receives such payments from patients.

A more expeditious payment arrangement could have supplemented City finances
through interest income as far back as 2002. The City parties should negotiate new payment due
dates, including penalties for late payment.

HHC Response: “We disagree with the above statements for the following reasons:

continues to pay on a quarterly schedule, consistent with the terms and agreement
stipulated in the MOU. With the exception of Fiscal Year 2006, when the Corporation

Payment Delays Results in $5,052 in Unnecessary Late Fees

FDNY delayed processing several rental payments, through HHC’s OTPS system, for
one of its radio transmittal towers during Fiscal Year 2008. As a result, late fees were incurred
by FDNY in accordance with the lease provisions. However, it appears that since these
payments do not come directly from FDNY’s budget, but are instead deducted from funds
otherwise owed by HHC to FDNY, timely payment was not a priority. For example, on April 9,
2008, FDNY paid rent and license fees for services provided as far back as November 2007.
Under the lease, FDNY is required to pay rent on the first day of each month. Consequently,

Payment Delays Results in $5,052 in Unnecessary Late Fees

FDNY delayed processing several rental payments, through HHC’s OTPS system, for
one of its radio transmittal towers during Fiscal Year 2008. As a result, late fees were incurred
by FDNY in accordance with the lease provisions. However, it appears that since these
payments do not come directly from FDNY’s budget, but are instead deducted from funds
otherwise owed by HHC to FDNY, timely payment was not a priority. For example, on April 9,
2008, FDNY paid rent and license fees","fees for services provided as far back as November 2007.
Under the lease, FDNY is required to pay rent on the first day of each month. Consequently,
HHC’s final payment to the City on the Fiscal Year 2008 EMS Settlement Worksheet was
reduced by $5,052 due to late fees incurred by FDNY.

Inadequate Oversight To Ensure Accountability

The City is not providing adequate oversight to ensure adherence to the provisions of the
MOU. The substantial amounts of funds being transferred called for significantly more attention
than they received. The additional charges with respect to the use of Sea View and the lockbox,
untimely payment for non-Medicaid revenue, and late fees for OTPS expenses, could all have
been prevented. Since these EMS payments and associated expenditures reside with HHC, it
appears these funds were not subject to the appropriate oversight that should occur, resulting in
the reported findings.

Therefore, we continue to recommend that HHC negotiate with OMB on these issues and
formalize appropriate modifications to the MOU.

6. Formally memorialize any modifications to the terms of the MOU as they occur.

HHC Response: “HHC concurs with this recommendation. With respect to requesting
delays to the payment of non-Medicaid revenue, which we believe is the issue that
prompted this recommendation; HHC will request that such approval is received in
writing from OMB.”

7. As EMS lease agreements expire, subsequent renewals should be in the name of

HHC Response: “HHC disagrees with the recommendation. . . . these leases should
remain in the name of HHC and rent payments processed through HHC, as such expense
historically has been included on HHC’s books and in the HHC Institutional Cost Report
(ICR) filed with the State, and therefore included in the capital cost component of HHC
Medicaid rates. If these rent expenses were not included in the ICR, HHC Medicaid rates
related to ambulance services would be reduced, which in turn would reduce HHC
payments to FDNY for the provision of EMS services.”

Auditor Comment: If HHC contends that the EMS leases must remain in the name of
HHC to maintain current Medicaid rates, then HHC and FDNY officials should
coordinate efforts that would relinquish payment processing duties to HHC in order to
avoid late fees.

OMB, on behalf of the City, should ensure that:

OMB Response: “OMB believes that HHC owes the City $1,503,131: $1,454,638 for
improper rent at Sea View and $48,493 for inadvertent accounting errors. HHC has
agreed to reimburse the City $1,503,131 and the $1,503,131 owed was included in the

started in 2002. Therefore, as more fully discussed above, quarterly payments are no
longer required by the MOU. Since FDNY is now performing the billing and collecting
functions, the City should receive payment more frequently than every three months.
Furthermore, liquidated damages would be imposed only if HHC delays payment without
written consent from OMB. We do not understand why HHC maintains that quarterly
payment for non-Medicaid revenue is still appropriate and that penalties should not be

11. A more expeditious payment schedule, a liquidated damages clause for delayed non-
Medicaid revenue payments, and any other revisions are formalized within the MOU.

OMB Response: “OMB will continue to work with HHC to ensure that payments are
made consistent with the terms of the MOU and as expeditiously as possible. Any delay
in payment would have to be authorized by OMB and as such OMB does not believe that
it is necessary or appropriate to add a liquidated damages clause.”

Auditor Comment: As previously stated, if EMS leases must remain in the name of HHC
to maintain current Medicaid rates, then FDNY and HHC officials should coordinate
efforts that would relinquish payment processing duties to HHC to avoid late fees.

While we agree with the audit","of approximately $1
billion to the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) with an accuracy rate of 99.99%, representing
approximately one million transactions over the nine year audit period.

After a thorough review of the draft audit report, HHC acknowledges your findings concerning the
Sea View rental payments of $1,454,638 and lack of documentation for vendor payments of
$48,493. Accordingly, we have attached a corrective action plan to resolve these mailers.

However, we do not concur wilh several findings (e.g., “Improper Bank Charges"", “Untimely
Payment for EMS Services” and “Lack of Supporting Documentation Supporting Approval of
Delayed Medicaid Payments’), and have prepared a detailed response as noted in Attachment |.

Improper Bank Charges

The MOU provides for the City to pay HHC a reasonable rate for the billing and/or collection of
revenues for EMS services provided to patients. Consistent with the MOU, corresponding bank
charges for collection services are reasonable and customary fees, and should not have been cited
in the report. Attachment | provides for a more detailed response to this finding.

Untimely Payment for EMS Services

The audit's interpretation of the MOU regarding ""Untimely Payment for EMS Services” is
misleading and inaccurate. As discussed more fully in Atlachment |, the language and practice
surrounding the MOU did not require a change in the quarterly payment schedule or structure
when the FDNY assumed responsibility in 2002 for billing non-Medicaid patients.

Lack of Supporting Documentation Supporting Approval of Delayed Medicaid","Medicaid Payments
While we agree with the audit’s recommendation to formalize HHC's request to postpone the
transfer of payments, the audit report failed to recognize that OMB works closely with HHC to
monitor its cash flow throughout the year. In circumstances where projected cash flow has the
potential to disrupt operations, as was the case during Fiscal Year 2006, delayed payments to the
City were permitted. There is no requirement that this arrangement be written. The letter received
from OMB on May 21, 2009 was made al the auditor's request, and nol an attempt to “ratify” the
prior practice.

Therefore, based on the above reasons and information provided in Attachment |, these findings
should be eliminated from the report.

In closing, HHC objects to the practice of adding new audit findings subsequent to issuance of
preliminary draft audit reports. A new audil finding, “Improper Bank Charges”, was introduced in the
final draft report for this audit, and was nol presented in the preliminary draft reporl or discussed
during fieldwork, the exit conference, or the three month interim period prior to issuance of the final
draft report. As a result, the Corporation was noi given an opportunity to provide documentation
that could have eliminated the finding. Had this finding been discussed with all three agencies
during any of lhe above stages, we believe the issue would have been effectively resolved.

Attachment J

Although the Comptroller's audit report cites specific areas in need of improvement, HHC takes
exception to the characterization that the Corporation ""Improperly"" deducted $2,450,578 in
offsets against EMS payments due the City. There were valid and substantive reasons for the
various deductions, as they were related to the Fire Department's ambulance services provided
under the existing MOU.  HHC has provided year-end reconciliations detailing all
deductions/adjusiments (0 the Fire Department in accordance with the MOU stipulations.
Further, the reconciliauons to the FDNY included the EMS lockbox/bank account charges which
were acceptable under the MOU as to their propriety or reasonableness. We have addressed each

of the audit findings as presented in the audit report.

The Draft Audit Report states (page 8):
$1,454,638 in Improper","Improper Rental Payments

“HELC improperly charged the City $1,454,638 as an offset against the Fiscal Year 2004 through
Fiscal Year 2008 payments to the City, for use of approximately 10,000 square feet of space in
the Integrated Facility Building, and 4,500 square feet of outdoor parking al Seca View
(collectively the “Premises”). Under a license agreement signed on July 20, 2000, HHC granted
the City occupancy of the Premises in exchange for FDNY performing quarterly preventative
maintenance on approximately 30 hospital vehicles, paving a 5,688 square foot parking lot for
hospital use, and installing fencing and lighting around the parking Jot area. Since FDNY
fulfilled its repair and maintenance requirements, HLIC should not have assessed any monetary

charges for use of the Premises.”

HHC’s Response

HHC concurs with the finding of incorrect charges for the rental of space at Sea View totaling
$1,454,638. he finds owed to the City have been reflected as a credit to the charges that WHC

HHC’s Response

This interpretation of the MOU is inappropriate. The lock box and the related bank account into
which EMS revenues flow is established under HHC’s tax [D number. The lock box is in the
name of FONY/EMS and captures all non-Medicaid revenues billed by the FDNY. Therefore, it
is appropriate to bill FONY/EMS for the $947,447 in bank costs assoctated with the operation of
the lock box because the $437 million in revenue that flowed through the lockbox arrangement
for Fiscal Years 2000-2008 between HHC and FDNY/EMS is paid to the City. The lockbox fees
are expenses thal are “passed through” to the FDNY/EMS.

Under the MOU, the party who ultimately receives the revenue for EMS services — the City -
should bear the costs of billing and collection. This is expressly so even when HFIC, rather than

FDNY, ts responsible for billing.

Thus, the MOU provides in paragraph 9 that “the City shall pay THILC a reasonable rate, as

The Draft Audit Report (page 10):

Untimely Payment for EMS Services

“HAC does not pay the City within a reasonable ume frame for the cost of EMS services. Since
2002, HHC has continuously delayed making timely payments to the City because it has
fotlowed an outdated practice of making quarterly payments based on projections of future non-
Medicaid","Medicaid collections. This process was established when MHC was billing and collecting EMS
payments. [lowever, once FDNY assuined the responsibility for billing functions, the projected
collection and quarterly payment process for non-Medicaid revenue should have ceased and

payment remitled much sooner than every three months.”

“Although the MOU no longer requires projected collections and quarterly paymenis because
FDNY performs the billing and collecting functions itself, the MOU did not specify the
frequency with which the City should reccive payment. There 1s no basis for FIHC to hold these
payments for this length of time. Accordingly, HHC should pay the City at least no later than

within 30 days from the date HHC receives such payments from patients.”

HHC’s Response

We disagree with the above statements Lor the following reasons:

e Since the transfer of EMS services to FDNY in 1996, the Corporation had paid and
continues 10 pay on a quarterly schedule, consistent with the terms and agreement
sUpulated in the MOU. With the exception of Fiscal Year 2006, when the Corporation
was going through a fiscal crisis, OMB granted HHC an extension to delay its quarterly
payment during this period. As the MOU has not been amended since its inception, the

quarterly payment schedule 1s not an “out-dated practice.”

by EMS should only be the EMS Jcase payments and only these amounts wil] be included from

HHC has always maintained supporting details and will continue to da so for refund checks

Audit Report on the Compliance of the Health and Hospitals Corporation with
the Financial Provisions of the Ambulance and Pre-hospital Emergency
Medical Services Memorandum of Understanding — FM08-08A

Audit Recommendations ~ Office of Management and Budget Response

8) OMB, on behalf of the City, should ensure that HHC pays the City
$2,450,578.

OWMIB Response: OMB believes that HHC owes the City $1,503,131: $1,454,638
for improper","improper rent at Sea View and $48,493 for inadvertent accounting errors. HHC
has agreed to reimburse the City $1,503,131 and the $1,503,131 owed was
included in the 6/30/09 EMS final settlement reconciliation.

The difference between the $1,503,131 payment that the City and HHC have
agreed on and the Comptroller's suggested amount of $2,450,578 is equai to the
bank charges for the EMS revenue lockbox ($947,447). Since the lockbox is a
separate HHC lockbox used solely for EMS revenue, it is appropriate that the cost of
the lockbox be paid for with EMS revenue. Therefore OMB finds that the lockbox

charges should not be returned.

9) OMB, on behalf of the City, should ensure that HHC adheres to the terms of
the MOU and that payments of EMS funds are promptly made to the City.

OMB Response: The City and HHC are currently adhering to the terms of the MOU
and payments of EMS funds to the City are made as expeditiously as possible.
OMB will continue to work with HHC to ensure that payments are made consistent
with agreed upon practice and the terms of the MOU.

10) OMB, on behalf of the City, should ensure that an annual reconciliation fs
performed to verify that all adjustments and credits taken by HHC against the

final payment are valid.

OMB Response: The City and HHC already perform an annual reconciliation to
verify adjustments and credits towards the EMS payment",86990,14135

The difference between the $1,503,131 payment that the City and HHC have
agreed on and the Comptroller's suggested amount of $2,450,578 is equai to the
bank charges for the EMS revenue lockbox ($947,447). Since the lockbox is a
separate HHC lockbox used solely for EMS revenue, it is appropriate that the cost of
the lockbox be paid for with EMS revenue. Therefore OMB finds that the lockbox

charges should not be returned.

9) OMB, on behalf of the City, should ensure that HHC adheres to the terms of
the MOU and that payments of EMS funds are promptly made to the City.

OMB Response: The City and HHC are currently adhering to the terms of the MOU
and payments of EMS funds to the City are made as expeditiously as possible.
OMB will continue to work with HHC to ensure that payments are made consistent
with agreed upon practice and the terms of the MOU.

10) OMB, on behalf of the City, should ensure that an annual reconciliation fs
performed to verify that all adjustments and credits taken by HHC against the

final payment are valid.

OMB Response: The City and HHC already perform an annual reconciliation to
verify adjustments and credits towards the EMS payment. This annual reconciliation
process will continue as it has in the past.

11) OMB, on behaflf of the City, should ensure that a more expeditious
payment schedule, a liquidated damages clause for delayed non-Medicaid","Medicaid
revenue payments and any other revisions are formalized within the MOU.

OMB Response: OMB will continue to work with HHC to ensure that payments are
made consistent with the terms of the MOU and as expeditiously as possible. Any
delay in payment would have to be authorized by OMB and as such OMB does not
believe that it is necessary or appropriate to add a liquidated damages Clause.

1) Ensure that rental payments are processed on time.

FDNY Response - The Department agrees with this recommendation. FDNY always
attempts to make timely payments on all invoices. We will ensure that all rental
payments are processed on time.

2) All EMS lease renewals should be in the name of the FDNY and all lease payments
processed through the FDNYs normal budgetary process.

FDNY Response - The Department disagrees with recommendation. Health and
Hospitals Corporation (HHC) has stated that these leases should remain in the name of
HHC and rent payments processed through HHC in order for the related rent expense to
be included on HHC's books and in the HHC Institutional Cost Report (ICR) filed with
the State. These space rent expenses reported in the JCR are then included in

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background

The Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center (hospital) is part of the
Generations+/Northern Manhattan Network (Network), which includes six New
York City Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) medical facilities. The
Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center Auxiliary, Inc. (Auxiliary) is a

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background

The Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center (hospital) is part of the

York City Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) medical facilities. The
Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center Auxiliary, Inc. (Auxiliary) is a
nonprofit organization that manages","manages funds designated for services and programs
that enhance the quality of patient care at the hospital. Both the Auxiliary and the
hospital are required to follow the operating procedures established by HHC and
to follow appropriate rules, regulations, and procedures for collecting and using
Auxiliary funds. In addition, the Auxiliary has its own bylaws.

The Auxiliary raises funds through donations, interest earned on Auxiliary
accounts, membership dues, and other revenue sources, including contracts with
concessionaires. The Auxiliary is also required to hold an annual fund-raising
event. These funds may be used for purchases deemed necessary for patient-
related care. According to its financial statements for the calendar year 2000, the
Auxiliary earned $502,580 and expended a total of $28,193, including $26,531
for Social Services and $1,662 for General and Administrative expenses. This
resulted in a surplus of $474,387, which increased the 1999 net assets balance of
$507,437 to $981,824 by the end of 2000.


## MG02_142A_page_3
Objectives

The objectives of this audit were to determine whether the Auxiliary’s
revenues and expenses were accurately and fairly reported, its internal control
structure over the collection and disbursement of funds was adequate, and
expenses were in compliance with prescribed procedures, guidelines, and bylaws.

Scope and Methodology

The scope of our audit was calendar year 2000. We reviewed the
Auxiliary’s books, records, and supporting documents for this period. We
included the last two quarters of 1999 and the first two quarters of 2001 in our",883,130

reconciliations","could be improved. Specifically:

e Two vendors owe the Auxiliary $5,029 in commission payments for
2000: the parking garage operator owed $4,310 and the vending
machine operator owed $719.

e The Auxiliary had uninsured bank deposits totaling $741,100.
e The Auxiliary had an excessive fund balance of $981,824 in 2000.

This audit makes four recommendations, which are listed below. The
Auxiliary Board and Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center should:

e Ensure that commission payments from all vendors are accurate.

e Collect the additional commission payments of $4,310 and $719 owed

by the parking garage and vending machine operators, respectively, for
2000.

e Place funds in collateralized accounts.

e Reduce the Auxiliary’s funds balance by identifying more patient-
care-related projects.

HHC Response

The matters covered in this report were discussed with officials from the
Auxiliary and Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center during and at the
conclusion of this audit. A preliminary draft report was sent to HHC officials on
May 7, 2002, and was discussed at an exit conference on May 23, 2002. On May
31, 2002, we submitted a draft report to HHC officials with a request for
comments. We received a written response from HHC officials on June 14, 2002,
which included a memorandum from Lincoln Hospital’s staff. In its response,
HHC said that it agreed with and will implement all four recommendations. The
President of HHC also stated, in part:

“To improve the monitoring and tracking of concession
fees","fees/commissions, the Facility will perform quarterly
reconciliations of payment and contract terms for each vendor.
Notices of delinquency will be sent for any overdue payments. If

necessary, the Auxiliary will utilize escrow accounts to satisfy
unpaid balances. To eliminate and/or reduce the uninsured fund
balances, the Auxiliary will make every effort to place funds in
collateralized accounts at other banking institutions. Also, to
reduce the surplus of funds, the Facility will work closely with the
Auxiliary to fund purposeful and constructive patient care-related
projects.”

To determine whether expenses were in compliance with prescribed guidelines and
procedures, we reviewed the disbursement request and supporting documents and compared the
expenditures with the criteria established by the Auxiliary’s bylaws and HHC’s operating
procedures.

This audit was conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The purpose of the Auxiliary is to engage in activities and projects that enhance the
quality of patient care. The Auxiliary’s expenditures were used to fulfill this purpose. For
example, the Auxiliary:

e Purchased for the hospital more than $200,000 worth of equipment for breast cancer
detection during calendar 1999,

e Sponsors an annual health fair at the hospital each year, and

e Sponsors the breast cancer awareness program, “Viva Mujer.”

The Auxiliary's financial statements fairly represent its financial condition. Its incurred
expenses were reasonable and were in compliance with prescribed procedures, guidelines, and

bylaws. Specifically:

e The Auxiliary properly recorded contributions, concession revenue, and investment
interest, and reconciled the cash receipts to the bank statements.

e Expenditures were accurately posted to the general ledger. All canceled and voided
checks",12579,1914
Comptroller_Reports/MG02_142A.pdf,1,fees,Fee for Service,42.10526315789473,lemma,"000”

The parking garage paid the monthly fees of $20,833.33, for a total","reviewed the related contract stipulations and found that:


## MG02_142A_page_11
e All concession contracts were current

e Revenues were accurately recorded in the general ledger

e Payments were received in a timely manner

e Since April 2000, a log has been used to record the date when concession payments
are received

e There are written policies and procedures for the sale of telephones to patients

Although concession revenues were accurately recorded, we found that the parking
garage owed the Auxiliary an additional $4,310 in commissions related to the contract period
ending April 30, 2000. In addition, the vending machines company owes the auxiliary an
additional $719 in commission payments.

Moneys Owed by the Garage Concession in 2000

The contract between the parking garage and the hospital for the period March 1999 to
April 2002 stipulates:

“Each month, the contractor shall forward a check to the hospital’s comptroller, or
its written designee representing a commission based upon a percentage of gross
receipts from operation of the Parking Spaces for the preceding month. The
monthly commission shall be equal to (a) $20,833.33 (one twelfth of the annual
guarantee of $250,000) plus a percentage of the monthly gross receipts received
from operation of the Parking Spaces, net of sales tax, in accordance with the
following schedule:” [Emphasis in original]

“50% from $540,000 to $599,999.99
“85% from $600,000 to $849,999.99
“95% from $850,000 to $1,000,000”

The parking garage paid the monthly fees","fees of $20,833.33, for a total of $250,000 for the
contract year ending April 30, 2000. However the garage’s total income for the contract year
was $644,279, which exceeded the $540,000 threshold. Therefore, the parking garage had to pay
additional commissions in accordance with the contract stipulations. While the parking garage
did pay additional commissions, the amount paid to the Auxiliary was short by $4,310.01, as
illustrated in Table I, below.

As stipulated in the contract, the parking garage is supposed to pay one twelfth of the
annual guarantee of $250,000 or $20,833.33 each month plus a percentage of monthly gross
receipts that exceed $540,000. The parking garage submitted a total of $25,689.98, relating to the
50 percent threshold, instead of the $29,999.99 that should have been paid. Therefore, the
parking garage owes the Auxiliary $4,310 in commission payments for April 2000. When we
mentioned this underpayment to the Network Contract Liaison, he agreed that a payment error
had been made.

determined that the Auxiliary had a balance of $1,139,618 in its bank accounts. Therefore, even
if the Auxiliary spent the $400,000 as planned, it would still have a significant amount of funds
in the bank.

As the CPA firm pointed out, such large fund balances could jeopardize the Auxiliary’s
tax-exempt status. More important, the Auxiliary’s purpose is to raise funds to support services
that enhance the quality of patient care at the hospital; maintaining a large surplus of funds in
bank accounts fails to achieve that purpose. The Auxiliary should make a greater effort to
reduce its surplus by identifying areas in the hospital that need additional resources, and spend
funds from its surplus for such projects.


## MG02_142A_page_16
Recommendation
The Auxiliary Board and Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center should:

4. Reduce the Auxiliary’s fund balance by identifying more patient-care-related
projects.

HHC Response: “We concur with the finding and will work closely with the Lincoln
Auxiliary to identify projects that could be funded. Based on average revenues over the
past three years, a budget will be prepared to assist the Auxiliary in finding worthwhile
patient-care-related projects to reduce the fund balance.”

AUDIT REPORT IN BRIEF

The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) provides City residents
with comprehensive medical and mental health services as well as treatment for substance abuse.
Coney Island Hospital is part of the HHC Southern Brooklyn and Staten Island Health Network
and has both medical and non-medical employees who are required to follow HHC Operating

review the internal controls of Coney Island Hospital over personnel, payroll, and timekeeping
for its active, non-medical, full-time, administrative staff, and to determine whether it is in
compliance with HHC policies and procedures and other applicable regulations.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

The audit found that Request for Leave forms were present and approved for all annual
and sick leave taken by the 40 employees in our sample. All leave use was appropriately
deducted from the employees’ leave balances, and the employees were accruing the correct
amount of annual and sick leave specified in the leave regulations. Payroll taxes were calculated
accurately and deductions were correctly applied. In addition, personnel folders were in good
condition, clearly labeled, and filed in alphabetical order.

However, some of the personnel folders were incomplete or contained inaccurate
information. In addition, there were weaknesses in the controls over timesheets and paycheck
distribution, and some employees were being paid above the maximum salary for their title. The
audit also found that timekeeping documents were incomplete.

with comprehensive medical and mental health services as well as treatment for substance abuse.
Coney Island Hospital is part of the HHC Southern Brooklyn and Staten Island Health Network
and has both medical and non-medical employees who are required to follow HHC Operating
Procedures and the time and leave regulations. The primary objectives of this audit were to
review the internal controls of Coney Island Hospital over personnel, payroll, and timekeeping
for its active, non-medical, full-time, administrative staff, and to determine whether it is in
compliance with HHC policies and procedures and other applicable regulations.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

The audit found that Request for Leave forms were present and approved for all annual
and sick leave taken by the 40 employees in our sample. All leave use was appropriately
deducted from the employees’ leave balances, and the employees were accruing the correct
amount of annual and sick leave specified in the leave regulations. Payroll taxes were calculated
accurately and deductions were correctly applied. In addition, personnel folders were in good
condition, clearly labeled, and filed in alphabetical order.

However, some of the personnel folders were incomplete or contained inaccurate
information. In addition, there were weaknesses in the controls over timesheets and paycheck
distribution, and some employees were being paid above the maximum salary for their title. The
audit also found that timekeeping documents were incomplete.

Hospital to discuss the timekeeping process in their department and observe the location of the

timesheets.

We reviewed the payroll transaction reports to determine whether the payroll process was
complete. We also analyzed the payroll register to determine whether the employees’ taxes were

calculated accurately and the deductions were correctly applied. We compared the employee
salary listing, received from the personnel department at Coney Island, with the payroll registers
and Personnel Action Forms in the personnel files to determine whether the employees were
being paid within the appropriate salary range for their titles.

To assess the hospital’s internal controls, we interviewed officials responsible for
personnel, payroll, and timekeeping. We also conducted in-depth reviews of applicable
personnel, payroll and timekeeping procedures. We then prepared schedules analyzing the
timekeeping and payroll transactions.

Our audit was conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing
Standards (GAGAS) and included tests of the records and other auditing procedures considered
necessary. This audit was performed in accordance with the City Comptroller’s audit
responsibilities as set forth in Chapter 5, § 93, of the New York City Charter.

As required by the New York State Health Code, Coney","Coney Island Hospital must insure that
the health status of each employee is reassessed annually to assure that each employee is free
from health impairment that might pose a potential risk to a patient or that might interfere with
the performance of the employee’s duties. The procedure also states that a copy of the medical
clearance must be retained in the employee’s personnel folder.

After reviewing the personnel folders of the 40 sampled employees, we were not able to
find copies of updated annual physicals for 11 employees. We found evidence of their last
physical that was performed over a year ago; however, records of current physicals were not in
the folders. After bringing this to the attention of hospital officials, they acknowledged that
records for the updated physicals were not present in the personnel folders because of filing
errors. Subsequently, they had the Employee Health Division of the hospital provide them with
duplicate copies of the employees’ updated annual physicals.

Additionally, there were two rollover employees (previously working for Coney Island
Hospital’s affiliate but now working for Coney Island Hospital) who had no evidence of having
had any annual physicals.

In addition, the Coney Island Hospital Policy and Procedure Manual states that all
employees are required to complete annual, mandated, in-service training; a copy of the

Employees Paid Above the Maximum Salary

Coney Island Hospital officials supplied us with a HHC Corporate Plan of Titles, dated
September 2002, that lists the corporate titles, title codes, and salary ranges for Group 11 and
Group 12 employees. We compared the salaries of 40 employees with the amounts shown on the

maximum salary listed. We expanded our sample to include all 183 managerial employees and

employee’s status or pay. According to Coney Island Hospitals Policy & Procedure 20-11
regarding PAFs, the PAF is used any time an employee is appointed, transferred, promoted,
given a change in salary rate, or separated from employment. Furthermore, it provides recording
changes in name or address, leaves of absence, or other actions.

If the personnel folders are incomplete because of a lack of periodic review and updated
documents, it will be difficult to obtain accurate information about a particular employee at any
given time. Periodic reviews and updates of required documentation will ensure complete and
updated personnel folders for the employees of Coney Island Hospital.

Recommendations
Coney Island Hospital should conduct periodic review of personnel folders to:

1. Ensure that all documents required by HHC and Coney Island Hospital are present in
the appropriate personnel folders.

HHC Response: Regarding the Coney Island Hospital checklist, HHC stated “the related
recommendation will not be implemented.” HHC also stated: “The HR [Human
Resources] Department reviews all folders prior to the employee’s appointment to work.
Please note, not all items on the check list apply to all employees.”

Auditor Comment: Although in its response, HHC stated that it would not implement this
recommendation, we believe that HHC did not understand the intent of our
recommendation. As stated above, we recommend that Coney Island Hospital ensure that
all documents required by HHC and Coney","Coney Island Hospital should be present in the
appropriate personnel folder.

2. Ensure that records for updated annual physicals; mandated in-service training; and
performance evaluations are completed and included in the personnel folder.

they did not receive their paychecks when in fact they did.

Additionally, the undistributed paychecks are not returned to the Payroll Department, as

departments and found that the timesheets are not always within view of the timekeeper or
supervisor. This is of concern to us because we were told that the employees do not fill in their
timesheets daily and the timesheets generally require only an “X” to indicate the employee’s
work presence. For example, if an employee’s designated shift is 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every
day and the employee follows that schedule, then the timesheet requires an “X” on arrival and
another “X’’ when leaving. If the employee works different hours or arrives late or leaves early,
then the time worked is to be written in. This procedure lacks controls, since anyone can place
an “X” in a box at any time and since there is no one to verify that the employee completed his
or her own timesheet or that the employee arrived at work or left at the scheduled time.

Auditor Comment: As stated in the report, 12 percent of the managerial employees in
Coney Island Hospital are being paid above the maximum salary for their titles. Many of
these employees received a managerial increase as part of an HHC-wide managerial
increase. Therefore, the salaries for many HHC employees may have been affected by
this managerial increase. Since the salaries for many managerial employees may be
above the maximum, HHC should reconsider our recommendation and update its
Corporate Plan of Titles.

made.

requests for merit salary increase will require appropriate justification, including
increased responsibilities which will be filed in the HR folder.”

5. Require that, in addition to the timekeepers signing for the payroll checks, each
employee should sign for his or her own paycheck.

HHC Response: “There is no policy and procedure requiring employees to sign for their
paychecks. Coney Island Hospital has not encountered any problems with their current
procedure. Checks that are lost are for the most part the fault of the employee losing the
paycheck after received. The payroll department accounts for each check and advice that

HHC Response: “Regarding the Corporate Plan of Titles, it is not HHC’s intent to
increase salary maximums for the small number of employees that may have exceeded
the salary caps during your review. Generally employees may exceed the caps for

various reasons including justifiable exceptions, collective bargaining, longevity, merit,
contractual and managerial increases.”

Auditor Comment: As stated in the report, 12 percent of the managerial employees in
Coney Island Hospital are being paid above the maximum salary for their titles. Many of
these employees received a managerial increase as part of an HHC-wide managerial
increase. Therefore, the salaries for many HHC employees may have been affected by
this managerial increase. Since the salaries for many managerial employees may be
above the maximum, HHC should reconsider our recommendation and update its
Corporate Plan of Titles.

Coney Island Hospital should:

4. Ensure that written justification is submitted when requests for merit increases are
made.

HHC Response: “Commencing immediately, the HR Director will ensure that all
requests for merit salary increase will require appropriate justification, including
increased responsibilities which will be filed in the HR folder.”

5. Require that, in addition to the timekeepers signing for the payroll checks, each
employee should sign for his or her own paycheck.

HHC Response: “There is no policy and procedure requiring employees to sign for their
paychecks. Coney","Coney Island Hospital has not encountered any problems with their current
procedure. Checks that are lost are for the most part the fault of the employee losing the
paycheck after received. The payroll department accounts for each check and advice that
leaves the payroll office before it is given to the designated representative for
distribution. The large volume of employees now on direct deposit also curtails checks
being lost.”

Auditor Comment: Comptroller's Directive #13 requires “Every transfer of payroll
checks. . . must be evidenced by the recipient’s signature.” Although HHC does not
adhere to this directive, requiring signatures for paychecks would enhance the internal
controls over payroll distribution and is a good business practice.

6. Ensure that undistributed checks are returned to the Payroll Department at the end of
the payday.

HHC Response: ‘‘A memo was issued dated 6/19/03 to reinforce this practice. At the
end of each payday, the department supervisor or designee will return undistributed
paychecks/advices to the Payroll Department. Please see Exhibit 1.”

7. Ensure that employees fill in their timesheets daily.

Incomplete Timekeeping Documents

All employees must fill out timesheets daily. The timesheet is used to record the time
employees’ start and end work, their leave use, overtime worked, and compensatory time
accrued. This information is used to calculate the employee leave balances and to generate
paychecks. An employee is also required to complete a Request for Leave of Absence form
when leave is requested. The employee’s supervisor must approve the Request for Leave of
Absence form, and the Payroll Department should receive these slips before payday.

We reviewed the timekeeping documents for the 40 sampled employees for the pay
periods January 17, 2003 and January 31, 2003. We found that the information on the timesheets
accurately reflected the use of annual and sick leave. However, some of the timesheets were not
signed.

Lack of Signatures on Timesheets

According to the Coney Island Hospital policies and procedures, the supervisor’s
signature on the weekly timesheet constitutes authorization and approval of the work schedule,
the days and hours actually worked, and the employee’s actual reporting time.

During our review of 160 timesheets for the period December 29, 2002 to January 25,

and the supervisor did not sign the timesheet. Although there were no signatures on these
timesheets, the employees received their paychecks. Although these occurrences are infrequent,
the fact that someone would approve an unsigned timesheet or that a timesheet would contain no
signatures, and these timesheets would still be processed is of concern. As a result of this
practice, employees may be compensated for time not worked, or inaccurate information may be

RE: DRAFT AUDIT REPORT ON THE CONTROLS OVER PERSONNEL, PAYROLL, AND
TIMEKEEPING AT CONEY ISLAND HOSPITAL (Audit # MG03-142A)

Dear Mr. Brooks:

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the draft audit report concerning the Corporation's controls over
Personnel, Payroll and Timekeeping at Coney Island Hospital. | was pleased to read that appropriate practices
and procedures are maintained at Coney Island Hospital to correctly calculate, accrue, document and approve
employees’ leave balances as specified in HHC’s leave regulations, and payroll taxes were calculated
accurately and deductions were correctly applied.

With the exception of several minor issues the Facility generally maintains good control over these payroll and
timekeeping functions. However, the auditors have provided some useful recommendations and the Facility
has taken steps to implement additional controls that will improve the Facility’s operation and the maintenance
of the voluminous paperwork filed by our Human Resources Department,

Regarding the Corporate Plan of Titles, it is not HHC’s intent to increase salary maximums for the small
number af employees that may have exceeded the salary caps during your review. Generaily employees may
exceed the caps for various reasons including justifiable exceptions, collective bargaining, longevity, merit,
contractual and managerial increases.

Your audit also stated that none of the 40 folders contained all the required documents that Coney","Coney Island
Hospital specified on its [check] list. As explained at the exit conference this check list is not utilized to identify
all documents to be maintained in an employee folder. It does not apply to all employees and the maintenance
of certain documents depends on the date of employment and existing Operating procedures at the relevant
point in time. Therefore, the related recommendation wil! not be implemented.

In addition, the recommendation to require all employees to sign for their check or advice is an unnecessary
additional administrative step. There are enough compensating cantrols within the Facility’s processes and the
banking system that would prevent an employee from claiming they did not receive their check. Moreover,

ADDENDUM
Page 2 of 9

most employees are now on direct deposit and the Facility has not encountered any problems with their current
procedure.

We have also included with our response, documentation for annual ohysicals for two employees mentioned in
your report that transferred from the affiliate to the hospital. Their documentation was not in their respective
folders but was maintained in the Employee Health Services Department (Attachment Ill),

Attachment | is the Facility's detailed response, Attachment Il is the Audit Implementation Plan, which
addresses all the recommendations cited in the report. |

Should you have any questions conceming this response, please contact Mr. Alex Scoufaras, Assistant Vice
President, Intemal Audits at (212) 730-3123.

Sincerely,

checks. Coney Island Hospital does follow a procedure to ensure paychecks are
picked up, signed for and distributed by the same individual and we maintain
proper controls on this system.

Further, the two (2) PC rollovers which did not demonstrate evidence of a
physical in the HHC personne! folder did, in fact, have evidence of such in the
employees’ falders in the Employee Health Service Department; personnel
folders have extension folders residing in EHS, staff development, and, in some
cases, in the departments where employees work because of the type of data
kept.

All other recommendations are attached with backup data,
Thank you. |

Audit Report on the Inventory Controls of
Bellevue Hospital Center
Over Noncontrolled Drugs
And Medical and Surgical Supplies

MG03-179A
AUDIT REPORT IN BRIEF

The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) provides City residents
with comprehensive medical and mental health services, as well as treatment for substance
abuse, regardless of ability to pay. HHC hospitals, clinics, and other facilities require substantial
quantities of drugs and medical and surgical supplies, and must ensure that items are in stock
when needed. To maintain inventory records, each facility has access to the HHC computerized
OTPS (Other Than Personal Services) procurement management system. During Fiscal Year
2003, Bellevue Hospital, the facility covered by this audit, spent approximately $15 million for
drugs (controlled and noncontrolled) and $8 million for medical and surgical supplies. Our
objective was to evaluate the adequacy of the internal controls over Bellevue",3293,357

Department does not","has access to the HHC computerized
OTPS (Other Than Personal Services) procurement management system. During Fiscal Year
2003, Bellevue Hospital, the facility covered by this audit, spent approximately $15 million for
drugs (controlled and noncontrolled) and $8 million for medical and surgical supplies. Our
objective was to evaluate the adequacy of the internal controls over Bellevue Hospital’s
inventory of noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

Bellevue Hospital has inadequate controls over its inventory of noncontrolled drugs and
medical and surgical supplies. Our review of its inventory practices disclosed significant
weaknesses in the issuing, recording, maintenance, and security of both types of inventories. It
failed to institute and enforce the controls necessary to ensure the proper safeguarding and
accounting of its inventories. Because of these significant weaknesses, we were unable to
determine with reasonable assurance that inventory items were appropriately issued from the
storerooms to the operating departments. As a result, we concluded that Bellevue Hospital’s
noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies are vulnerable to theft and
misappropriation.

The Pharmacy Department at Bellevue Hospital does not maintain its inventory records
on an adequate or appropriate perpetual inventory system; it uses inventory cards kept next to the
corresponding noncontrolled drug to manually record the receipt and issuance of the drug.
Numerous unsupported adjustments were made to the inventory card balances, and discrepancies
between the amounts on hand and the recorded balances were not investigated. The Pharmacy

1 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_5
Department does not maintain a complete list of noncontrolled drugs kept in the stockroom, and
has no documentation to support all the inventory issued from the Pharmacy stockroom. Further,
the segregation of responsibilities in the stockroom was inadequate: the stockroom employee
who receives and issues noncontrolled drugs also maintains and updates the inventory cards; and
access to the Pharmacy was inadequately restricted.

Central Supply Stores, responsible for the purchasing and issuing of medical and surgical
supplies, maintains no perpetual inventory records; instead, it conducts an inventory count at the
end of each fiscal year. (Because there were no existing perpetual inventory records, we did not
perform an inventory count of medical and surgical supplies.) In addition, our observation of the
basement stockroom revealed that medical and surgical supplies were not always properly
safeguarded, as excess inventory was stored in the basement hallways (photographs of the
inadequate storage space appear in the body of this report).

Finally, neither the Pharmacy Department nor Central Supply Stores properly conducted
their year-end physical counts. Moreover, the HHC auditors from the Office of Internal Audit
did not adequately perform the inventory count verification at Bellevue Hospital Pharmacy
Department and Central Supply Stores. Based on the figures shown on the inventory cards,
Bellevue Hospital may not have included approximately $1.6 million of noncontrolled drugs in
its valuation of inventory. Therefore, we estimate that HHC’s financial statements for Fiscal
Year 2003 may also be understated by $1.6 million.

Audit Recommendations

The report makes 17 recommendations, some of which are listed below. Bellevue
Hospital officials should:

Institute and enforce proper internal controls over its inventory of noncontrolled
drugs maintained in the stockroom. The Pharmacy should: maintain its inventory of
noncontrolled drugs separate from the related inventory records; assign different
personnel to handle the drugs and to update the inventory records; and ensure that
only designated personnel have access to the stockroom.

Ensure that the Pharmacy Department maintains a computerized perpetual inventory
system for its inventory of noncontrolled drugs kept in the stockroom. The perpetual

inventory records should be kept separate from the physical inventory.

Ensure that adjustments to inventory records (for noncontrolled drugs) are
documented, reviewed, and approved by appropriate Pharmacy officials.

Restrict access to the Pharmacy stockroom to authorized stockroom personnel.

Ensure that all noncontrolled drugs stored in the Pharmacy stockroom are correctly
counted, and their total quantity and value correctly reported.

2 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_6
e Ensure that Central Supply Stores maintains perpetual inventory records, preferably
on a computerized inventory system. Central Supply Stores should ensure that the
persons updating the inventory records are different from the persons handling the
inventory; and access to the inventory records should be restricted to designated
personnel.

Ensure that Central Supply Stores maintains all medical and surgical supplies in a
locked and restricted area so that they are properly safeguarded.

Ensure that when preparing and conducting the physical inventory count of the
medical and surgical supplies, its staff follow the inventory count procedures outlined
in the Inventory Procedures Manual.

HHC Response

The matters covered in this report were discussed with Bellevue Hospital officials during
and at the conclusion of this audit. A preliminary draft report was sent to HHC officials on
November 30, 2004, and was discussed at an exit conference on January 14, 2005. On March 3,
2005, we submitted a draft report to HHC officials with a request for comments. On March 18,
2005, we received HHC’s response, which included a letter from the Acting President of HHC
and responses from officials at Bellevue Hospital and the HHC Office of Internal Audits.

INTRODUCTION

Background

The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) provides City residents
with comprehensive medical and mental health services as well as treatment for substance abuse,
regardless of their ability to pay. Within its seven regional health care networks, HHC operates
11 acute-care hospitals; four long-term care facilities; six diagnostic and treatment centers; one
certified home health agency; and a large number of community-based primary care, dental, and
child health clinics.

HHC hospitals, clinics, and other facilities require substantial quantities of drugs and
medical and surgical supplies, and must ensure that items are in stock when needed. HHC has a
computerized OTPS (Other Than Personal Services) procurement management system that stores
perpetual inventory records. To maintain and update its records, each facility has access to the
system, and the system, based on minimum and maximum quantities, includes a reorder point for
each item at each facility.' The OTPS system can generate a purchase requisition when the
reorder point is reached. In addition, HHC requires that each facility count its physical inventory
at the end of each fiscal year.

Bellevue Hospital Center (Bellevue Hospital), the facility covered by this audit, is part of
the HHC South Manhattan Healthcare Network. This audit reviewed the inventory controls put
in place by HHC and Bellevue Hospital over noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical

supplies (i.e., intravenous solutions, baby formula, diapers, syringes, needles, bed liners, and
tubing). Drugs are classified as either controlled or noncontrolled",12016,1553

All shipments to","intravenous solutions, baby formula, diapers, syringes, needles, bed liners, and
tubing). Drugs are classified as either controlled or noncontrolled. Controlled drugs, which are
not a subject of this audit, are regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration, a federal law
enforcement agency, which has strict requirements for the storage, record-keeping, and
dispensing of controlled drugs. These regulations do not pertain to noncontrolled drugs.

During Fiscal Year 2003, the total cost of drugs (controlled and noncontrolled) purchased
by the Pharmacy Department at Bellevue Hospital was approximately $15 million. The total cost
for medical and surgical supplies purchased by Central Stores was about $8 million. According
to the Physical Inventory Evaluation report (Exhibit H) that Bellevue Hospital prepared and
submitted to HHC, the value of the inventory of all drugs at the end of Fiscal Year 2003 was
$1,128,634, and the value of the medical and surgical supplies was $2,183,791.

When ordering medical and surgical supplies, Bellevue Hospital staff uses the OTPS
system to prepare requisitions and purchase orders. When ordering noncontrolled drugs, the
staff uses both OTPS and its primary vendor computer system. Therefore, purchases are
recorded in OTPS. However, when the purchased noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical
supplies are issued from the storerooms, they are not deducted from the inventory quantities
recorded in the OTPS system.

' The reorder point is reached when the quantity of a stored item is so depleted that it is necessary to
reorder.

## MG03_179A_page_8
All shipments to Bellevue Hospital are delivered to the hospital receiving dock. When
shipments for the Pharmacy are unloaded, the truck driver takes the delivery to the Pharmacy
stockroom. The Pharmacy personnel check each shipment for accuracy and then enter the items
onto the manual inventory cards maintained for each item in inventory. These cards are kept in
the stockroom, near the related inventory items. The Pharmacy stockroom receives requests for
noncontrolled drugs from the Main Pharmacy; the Out Patient Pharmacy (OPD); four in-patient
satellite pharmacies; and various out patient clinics. According to Pharmacy Department
procedures, pharmacists from the Pharmacy subdivisions can requisition pharmaceuticals by use
of an approved issue book or an approved order sheet. These documents are brought to the
stockroom and an assigned stockroom employee fills the requested order; the issued items are
recorded on the manual inventory cards.

When medical and surgical shipments are unloaded, the items received are logged into
the Receiving Department logbook. The items are transferred to one of the two storage areas in
Central Supply Stores: either the warehouse in the basement or the storeroom on the 14th floor.
Most of the bulk items are first stored in the basement warehouse and then, as they are requested,
transferred to the 14th floor storeroom. Needles, syringes, and smaller items are stored only on
the 14th floor. The storekeeper of the warehouse in the basement verifies the delivered items
against the packing slips. Afterwards, the packing slips and purchase",15182,2035

To ensure that","Omnicell machines, which are computerized storage units
that store medical and surgical supplies. These machines operate like vending machines and
allow nurses and storeroom staff, using individual personal codes, to open the Omnicell machine
to add or remove supplies. The staff are required to enter the quantities (using the machine
buttons) that are being added or removed, which enables the computer to track the quantity of
items used by a particular hospital unit. For those areas of the hospital that do not have an
Omnicell machine, designated storage areas are used to store the medical and surgical supplies.

To determine the value of the inventory to be reported on HHC’s financial statements,
HHC requires each facility to perform a fiscal year-end inventory count in all departments that
store inventory. The inventory is first recorded manually on preprinted inventory lists (count
sheets) by the employees counting the inventory. The count sheet results are then entered in the
computer as a spreadsheet to generate formal inventory reports (e.g., Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory
Report), which list the individual inventory items. The inventory reports are then summarized so
the hospital drugs (controlled and noncontrolled) and the medical and surgical supplies each
appear as an individual item showing the total dollar value. This summary of the value of all the
hospital’s inventory by categories is referred to as Exhibit H. This is submitted to HHC to be
used for its annual financial statements.

5 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_9
To ensure that the inventory counts performed by the hospitals are performed accurately,
HHC internal auditors from the Office of Internal Audits verify the count on a sampling basis by
counting 10 or more inventory items and comparing the results with the hospital’s inventory
count of those items. (If differences exist, further testing may be performed.) Once HHC
auditors complete the verification of the inventory, they inform the external auditors that the
inventory records can be relied on. Based on that reliance, the CPA firm attests to the accuracy
of the inventory value shown in the financial statements.

Objective

Our audit objective was to evaluate the adequacy of the internal controls over Bellevue
Hospital’s inventory of noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies.

Scope and Methodology

The scope period of this audit was Fiscal Years 2003 and 2004. Our fieldwork was
conducted from June 2003 through April 2004.

To achieve our audit objectives, we reviewed the following HHC documents and
procedures:

Inventory Verification for Fiscal Year 2003;

Inventory Procedure Manual;

Operating Procedure No. 140-1, Requisitioning Drugs and Pharmaceuticals;
Operating Procedure No. 110-24, Unauthorized Procurements; Operating Procedure
No. 110-1, Procurement of Supplies, Services and Equipment; and

Materials Management Inventory Procedures Manual.

We also reviewed the policies and procedures issued by the Pharmacy Department
covering the following subjects: requisitioning, issuing, and receiving pharmaceuticals;
disposition of returned drugs; inpatient drug distribution under the unit dose drug distribution
system; daily operation of Pharmacy satellites; and",18821,2607

Scope and Methodology

The scope period of this audit was Fiscal Years 2003 and 2004. Our fieldwork was
conducted from June 2003 through April 2004.

To achieve our audit objectives, we reviewed the following HHC documents and
procedures:

Inventory Verification for Fiscal Year 2003;

Operating Procedure No. 110-24, Unauthorized Procurements; Operating Procedure
No. 110-1, Procurement of Supplies, Services and Equipment; and

Materials Management Inventory Procedures Manual.

We also reviewed the policies and procedures issued by the Pharmacy Department
covering the following subjects: requisitioning, issuing, and receiving pharmaceuticals;
disposition of returned drugs; inpatient drug distribution under the unit dose drug distribution
system; daily operation of Pharmacy satellites; and purchasing of pharmaceuticals under HHC
guidelines. We reviewed the policies and procedures of Central Supply Stores that govern the
following operations: receiving, distributing and ordering of supplies; handling of outdated
supplies; and manufacturer’s recall. To determine whether the policies and procedures were
actually followed, we subsequently performed observations at the Pharmacy Department and
Central Supply Stores.

We interviewed hospital officials, including the Controller, Director of the Pharmacy,
Director of Purchasing/Materials Management, Associate Director of Central Sterile Supply, and
Coordinating Manager of Central Supply.

To familiarize ourselves with the operations at the Pharmacy Department, we performed
a walk-through of all areas of the Pharmacy with the Controller, the Pharmacy Director, and the

6 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_10
Assistant Director. During our walk-through and observations of the Pharmacy subdivisions, we
observed the loading of carts and patient medication cassettes, and the receipt and storage of
noncontrolled drugs ordered from the stockroom. We also interviewed personnel from several
Pharmacy subdivisions.

Accompanied by the Controller, the Associate Director of Central Sterile Supply, and
supervisors from the basement warehouse and the 14th floor storeroom, we traced the flow of
medical and surgical supplies. We performed a walk-through of the intake and distribution
system—from the receiving dock, to the storerooms, to the Omnicell machines and supply rooms
on the hospital floors. We also accompanied Central Supply Stores personnel when they
inspected the inventory levels of Omnicells and other storage areas, collected items needed from
the storeroom, and then distributed the items to the hospital floors.

To assess the hospital’s internal controls, we prepared detailed flowcharts of the
movement of noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical items. We observed how the
shipments arrived at the receiving dock, reviewed the logbook entries, and traced each shipment
to its final destination by comparing the entries in the receiving logbook with the delivery
receipts signed by the end-users.

To understand the process involved in the year-end inventory count performed by the
hospital staff and the verification of the count performed by HHC auditors, we observed the
fiscal year-end inventory counts and the subsequent verifications at both the Pharmacy
Department and Central Supply Stores. In addition",21444,2980

selected drugs. We","inventory

not provide a reliable listing of the population. To establish a population, we copied all the
manual inventory cards for all noncontrolled drugs kept in the stockroom for Fiscal Year 2003
and the first three months of Fiscal Year 2004. We compared the noncontrolled drugs listed on
the inventory cards to the noncontrolled drugs listed on the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report to
ensure that all noncontrolled drugs stored in the stockroom were included. We determined that
the Pharmacy stockroom had a population of 1,921 noncontrolled drugs that were available for
use in Fiscal Year 2003. We then randomly selected a sample of 300° noncontrolled drugs from
the population of 1,921 and performed a physical inventory count on February 18 and 19, 2004.
To maintain our sample size of 300, we replaced any out-of-stock drugs with other randomly

* Our sample sizes were based on prior experience in conducting audits of this type as well as the desire to select
sufficiently large samples that would allow us to project our results at meaningful confidence and precision levels.
We did in fact project the results of our sample of inventory counts of the 300 noncontrolled drugs. We did not
project the results of our sample of the manual inventory card adjustments (309 noncontrolled drugs) because the
sample results illustrated our finding effectively without projection.

selected drugs. We then compared our inventory count results to the recorded balances on the
inventory cards.

We randomly selected 309 noncontrolled drugs to determine whether the adjustments
made on their related inventory cards from July 1, 2002, though September 30, 2003 were
appropriate. We reviewed the inventory cards for each noncontrolled drug and determined how
many times the card was adjusted without a corresponding record of receipt or issuance. To
determine what investigation and approval processes were involved in these adjustments, we
requested documentation or a discrepancy/adjustment log. We were told by Pharmacy officials
that no such documentation or log was maintained. We also interviewed Pharmacy officials and
stockroom personnel and performed observations to determine whether procedures regarding
adjustments to correct discrepancies on the inventory cards were followed.

We requested from the Director of Pharmacy a list of Pharmacy personnel who were
allowed access to the stockroom and were assigned to receive, issue, and record the activities for
noncontrolled drugs. To determine whether access was adequately restricted, we conducted
unannounced observations for five days in March and April 2004—March 3, 4, April 22, 26, and
29.

To determine the accuracy of the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report, we attempted to
match the drugs listed on the count sheets to those listed on the Inventory Report. We found
inconsistencies in the first 35 drugs listed on the count sheets when compared to the Inventory
Report. We then compared the drugs listed on the Fiscal",25188,3566

balances on the manual inventory cards as of June 21, 2003, the date that the Pharmacy
conducted its inventory count. We also compared the noncontrolled drug prices listed on the
Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report to the June 2003 price list provided by the Pharmacy
Director.

To determine whether purchase orders were prepared properly, we interviewed staff
responsible for preparing the purchase orders for noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical
supplies. For the Pharmacy Department, we randomly selected a sample of 50 purchase order
numbers of 243 that we believed had been prepared in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2004. Of
the 50 purchase orders, one purchase order was cancelled and seven were not in fact prepared
during the first quarter of the fiscal year. We reviewed the remaining 42 purchase orders of 222
that we determined were prepared during the first quarter of the fiscal year. We also reviewed all
242 purchase orders for medical and surgical supplies that were prepared during July 1, 2003 to
September 30, 2003, the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2004. Bellevue Hospital’s Purchasing
Department prepares the medical and surgical supplies purchase orders after receiving a purchase
requisition from Central Supply Stores. We found these purchase orders to be in order.

Scope Limitation

We could not test the accuracy of the inventory of medical and surgical supplies at the
Central Supply Stores since no perpetual inventory records were maintained. Instead, to

determine whether all issued items could be accounted for, we selected a random sample of 226°
medical and surgical items from a population of 1,045 (as listed in the Fiscal Year 2003
Inventory Report) and conducted an inventory count between August 7 and August 12, 2003.
Using the balances from the Central Stores physical count in June 2003, we attempted to deduct
quantities issued and add quantities received between the dates of the hospital’s physical count
and our physical count. We copied all the manual and Omnicell issue sheets from July 2, 2003,
to August 12, 2003. However, we were not able to complete this test because the handwritten
issue sheets did not include the HHC catalog numbers, were incomplete and in many cases
illegible. Therefore, we were not able to identify the inventory items accurately, nor could HHC
officials identify specific inventory items based on the description recorded on the issue sheets.

This audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards (GAGAS) and included tests of the records and other auditing procedures considered
necessary. The audit was performed in accordance with the audit responsibilities of the City
Comptroller as set forth in Chapter 5, §93, of the New York City Charter.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Bellevue Hospital has inadequate controls over its inventory of noncontrolled drugs and
medical and surgical supplies. Our review of its inventory practices disclosed significant
weaknesses in the issuing, recording, maintenance, and security for both types of inventories.
Bellevue Hospital failed to institute and enforce the controls necessary to ensure the proper
safeguarding and accounting of its inventories. The Pharmacy Department and Central Supply
Stores at Bellevue Hospital purchased approximately $23 million worth of drugs and medical
and surgical supplies in Fiscal Year 2003. Because of these significant weaknesses, we were
unable to determine with reasonable assurance that these items were appropriately issued from
inventory to Bellevue Hospital’s operating departments. We believe that Bellevue Hospital’s
noncontrolled drugs and medical and surgical supplies are vulnerable to theft and
misappropriation.

We identified the following discrepancies and areas of concern:
The Pharmacy Department does not maintain its inventory records on an adequate or
appropriate perpetual inventory system nor does it maintain a complete list of
noncontrolled drugs kept in the stockroom. In addition, the Pharmacy Department
does not have documentation to support all the inventory issued from the Pharmacy

stockroom in Fiscal Year 2003.

The Pharmacy Department does not investigate discrepancies between the amounts
on hand and the amounts recorded.

The Pharmacy Department does not segregate the responsibilities of its personnel in
the Pharmacy stockroom. The stockroom employees that receive and issue
noncontrolled drugs also maintain the inventory cards.

Pharmacy Department_has Inadequate Controls
Over the Noncontrolled Drugs in its Stockroom

The Pharmacy Department failed to institute proper controls over its inventory operations
in the Pharmacy stockroom. As a result it is unable to ensure that waste and mismanagement of
inventory are minimized and that inventory is effectively protected against theft.

Effective inventory controls require accurate and up-to-date inventory records that are
maintained separate and apart from the actual inventory. Good controls also require adequate
segregation of duties and restricted access to the inventory items. We found that the Pharmacy
Department lacked the internal controls that would effectively protect the inventory of
noncontrolled drugs in the stockroom. In fact, the Pharmacy Department chose not to use the
HHC OTPS computerized perpetual inventory system that could have enhanced the department’s
internal controls over its noncontrolled drugs.

To maintain its inventory records in the stockroom, the Pharmacy Department keeps
manual inventory cards next to the corresponding noncontrolled drug. The stockroom personnel
record the receipt and issuance of inventory and keep a running balance of the inventory on
hand. However, the many handwritten inventory adjustments on the cards suggest that the actual
receipt and issuance of inventory are not always recorded or are not recorded accurately. For
example, during our April 26, 2004 observation, we observed an employee assigned to the main
pharmacy, not the",33841,4901

## MG03_179A_page_15
In addition, stockroom","that he could not find the inventory card so he did not
deduct the issuance of this noncontrolled drug from the inventory record. Further, this employee
did not submit an issue sheet, which would document the authorization for the issuance of this
noncontrolled drug. This is just one example that clearly indicates the Pharmacy Department’s
lack of controls over its noncontrolled drugs. First, this employee should not have had access to
the stockroom since he was not assigned to work there; second, there is no record of this drug
having been taken from the stockroom since it was not recorded on a related inventory card; and,
third, there is no documentation authorizing the drug issuance and indicating the destination of
the drug.

When there is a discrepancy between the balance on the inventory cards and the actual
number of items in inventory, stockroom personnel routinely make adjustments to the inventory
cards. The inventory cards are kept right next to the corresponding noncontrolled drug.
Although Pharmacy officials stated that this is done to ensure that the inventory cards accurately
identify the actual number of items available in inventory, adjustments are made without any
investigation or explanation for the discrepancies. This, we believe, explains the relatively minor
discrepancies we found between the amounts recorded on the inventory cards and the actual
number of items in inventory when we conducted a physical inventory count of a sample of
items (discussed later in the report).

## MG03_179A_page_15
In addition, stockroom employees perform all the tasks related to the inventory of
noncontrolled drugs; there is no segregation of responsibilities. The employees who receive and
issue the drugs also maintain the inventory cards. This violates the control principle that the
person responsible for maintaining the assets should be separate from the person maintaining the
records for that asset. When an employee maintains both the assets and the records, that
employee has the opportunity to remove items and manipulate the records so that any theft
would go undetected. These internal controls weaknesses may have resulted in the following
findings.

Inventory Records Inadequate and Inaccurate

The Pharmacy Department in Bellevue Hospital did not adhere to its own policy as set
forth in Procedure #78-71, which states: “There shall be a procedure for the proper receipt and
accounting of all pharmaceuticals and supplies purchased by the pharmacy based on approved
purchase orders.” The Pharmacy Department has failed to establish an inventory system that
properly accounts for its inventory. The Pharmacy did not have a complete list of the
noncontrolled drugs maintained in the stockroom and was unable to accurately determine the
dollar value of its inventory. Inventory records were not complete, and numerous adjustments
were made to inventory records without explanation or approval.

Manual Inventory System Inadequate and Inefficient

The Pharmacy Department’s system of maintaining inventory records is inadequate and
does not allow for the proper accounting and tracking of the inventory of noncontrolled drugs.

inventory cards in","OTPS computerized perpetual inventory
system or any other computerized inventory system to maintain its inventory of noncontrolled
drugs. In this, the Pharmacy has failed to follow its own procedures, which include steps that
clearly indicate that the OTPS computerized perpetual inventory system should be used.
Specifically, Procedure #78-71, Section I.E.5, states that upon receipt of pharmaceuticals and
supplies, “The packing slip and purchase order . . . [are] given to the OTPS computer entry
person as soon as the check in process is completed.” Section III.A.7 states that after inventory
discrepancies are discovered, investigated, and corrected, “The OTPS computer entry person
may now make all required entries into the system.” Section VI.D states that upon issuance of
drugs from the stockroom, “All completed orders will be given to the OTPS entry person for
deduction of all issues from inventory immediately upon completion of filling the order.”

The Pharmacy Department maintains its inventory records on manual inventory cards
that are kept next to the corresponding noncontrolled drug. The inventory cards, which are the
only record of the noncontrolled drugs stored in the Pharmacy stockroom, show the number of
items received and dispensed, and the balance of inventory on hand.

To test the inventory system in place, we requested from Pharmacy officials a complete
list of drugs maintained in the Pharmacy stockroom. We received numerous incomplete lists.
Bellevue Hospital officials concluded that a complete list could only be compiled from the

12 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_16
inventory cards in the Pharmacy stockroom. Therefore, for Fiscal Year 2003 and the first three
months of Fiscal Year 2004, we copied and reviewed all the available inventory cards for the
1,921 noncontrolled drugs stored in the stockroom.

Our review of the inventory cards revealed that for 220 of the 1,921 noncontrolled drugs
there is no record of inventory activity (receipts and issuance) for various parts of the time
reviewed. For the remainder of the time, we noted that these drugs were consistently received
and issued. Pharmacy officials could not provide us with an explanation or additional inventory
records to account for the missing information for the 220 drugs. In addition, it was difficult to
determine the total cost of the noncontrolled drugs on hand since the Pharmacy does not
maintain this information, nor does it include the cost of each drug on the inventory card. After
numerous requests, a Pharmacy official researched the price for each drug, which allowed us to
estimate a total cost of $2.6 million for the noncontrolled drugs, as of June 21, 2003.4

Using the system that is currently in place, the Pharmacy Department in Bellevue
Hospital cannot adequately account for the noncontrolled drugs in the stockroom. The inventory
cards serve neither as an inventory tool for management nor as a monitoring tool for Bellevue
Hospital or HHC. Inventory records must be maintained that are separate from the inventory.
Pharmacy officials should either use the OTPS inventory",40569,5925

the inventory is a key factor in promoting better controls.

Physical Count Results Inconclusive

We conducted a physical inventory count on February 18 and 19, 2004, to determine the
reliability of the manual inventory card system. We took a random sample of 300 drugs of the
total of 1,921 noncontrolled drugs stored in the stockroom and compared our results to the
inventory balances recorded on the manual inventory cards. For 20 (6.7%) of the 300 items, the
inventory count differed from the recorded balance on the inventory cards: for 14 items there
was less in the inventory (valued at $714) than was recorded, and for six items there was more in
the inventory (valued at $3,805) than was recorded. We are therefore 95 percent confident (+ or
- 2.59%) that of the 1,921 items in the population of noncontrolled drugs, there were
discrepancies (both shortages and overages) in the inventory records for 128 items (90 shortages
and 38 overages), or 6.7 percent.

However, after we conducted the inventory count, we found that numerous unsupported
adjustments were made to the inventory card balances, as discussed in the following section. We,
therefore, believe that the statistical results of our inventory count comparison to the manual
inventory cards are inconclusive. Neither the auditors nor Bellevue Hospital can rely on the

inventory records because they do not reflect inventory balances based on appropriate and
adequately documented inventory disbursements or receipts.

Improper Adjustments to Inventory Balances

Personnel in the Pharmacy Department made numerous adjustments to the balances on
the inventory cards without conducting proper investigations of the discrepancies. A review of a
random sample of inventory cards representing 309 of the 1,921 noncontrolled drugs found that
over the 15-month period reviewed—July 1, 2002 through September 30, 2003—1,393
adjustments, for a gross total of $315,630, were made on inventory cards for 229 (74%)
noncontrolled drugs in the sample.

According to Procedure #78-71: “When the amount on the inventory card does not
coincide with actual physical inventory” it should be brought to the attention of a supervisor who
should investigate the discrepancy. “If the problem cannot be rectified, it must be brought to the
immediate attention of the Director of the Pharmacy or one of the Assistant Directors.”

However, based on interviews with the stockroom personnel who maintain the inventory
cards and on our observations of the day-to-day operation of the stockroom, the procedures
outlined in Procedure #78-71 were not followed. Stockroom personnel said that whenever they
notice that an inventory balance does not match the inventory on hand, they adjust the inventory
balance accordingly. They do not investigate the discrepancies or determine the cause.

Based on our discussions with the Pharmacy officials, we determined that the correction
of discrepancies without investigation is a common and accepted practice and done to ensure that
the inventory cards accurately identifies the actual inventory on hand.

However, making adjustments to inventory records without proper investigation and
adequate justification removes a key control in safeguarding assets. With this practice in effect,
discrepancies are never accounted for. Pharmacy officials would have to analyze each individual
inventory card for every noncontrolled drug to know the extent of discrepancies and adjustments
made to the inventory records. Considering the number of adjustments we found, as well as the
number of times the balances for specific drugs were adjusted, we believe that, at a minimum,

number of times the balances for specific drugs were adjusted, we believe that, at a minimum,
the Pharmacy Department should maintain a comprehensive record of adjustments. In this way
Pharmacy officials would have a better understanding of the scope of discrepancies. More
important, the Pharmacy’s practice of routinely adjusting inventory balances reveals a serious
weakness in its controls over its noncontrolled drugs.

The Pharmacy Department has created an environment in its stockroom that has made the
inventory of noncontrolled drugs vulnerable to theft and misappropriation. Moreover, the
inadequacy of the record-keeping, the practice of making adjustments without investigation and
other internal controls deficiencies, has made it almost impossible to detect the theft and loss of
noncontrolled drugs.

Noncontrolled Drugs Not Purchased Properly

Pharmacy officials did not purchase noncontrolled drugs properly. According to the
Pharmacy Department’s Policy for Purchasing of Pharmaceuticals Under HHC Guidelines,
“Pharmaceuticals are obtained by issuance of a purchase order, generated by a requisition,
directly to a vendor with whom a price, shipping time and related conditions have been

15 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_19
previously established.” However, we found that purchase orders were often prepared after the
noncontrolled drugs had been ordered; the purchase orders did not include required information;
and, at times, drugs were ordered and received in exchange for credit memos without the use of
purchase orders. By not purchasing noncontrolled drugs properly and as required, the Pharmacy
Department has bypassed the controls put in place to properly account for all drugs purchased.

When Pharmacy officials determine that drugs should be purchased, the quantity and
description of the drugs should be entered into the OTPS system so that a purchase order can be
prepared. OTPS creates the purchase order, automatically assigning the next available purchase
order number. The purchase order should then be approved and authorized by appropriate
Pharmacy officials before the drugs are ordered from the vendor. When drugs are received from
vendors, the receipts should be recorded in the OTPS inventory system.

Upon our review, we found that the Pharmacy orders its drugs on-line from its primary
vendor, Cardinal, or by telephone from other vendors. When placing an order with Cardinal,
Pharmacy personnel always place the order on-line and then generate a confirmation for those
drugs that Cardinal can supply. Pharmacy personnel then generate an invoice from the vendor’s
computer system and prepare the purchase order using the OTPS system. Pharmacy officials
then approve the purchase orders at the end of the process.

We requested a list of all purchase orders for goods",49106,7280

Discussions with the","that she chooses a purchase order
number without any particular rationale or system when making a purchase. She could not offer
a reason for this procedure and simply stated that this was the usual practice.” After bringing this
matter to the attention of the Director of Pharmacy, the Pharmacy began using the purchase order
numbers automatically generated by the OTPS system.

We reviewed a random sample of 42 purchase orders, totaling $326,868, of the 222
prepared in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2004. We found that 19 (45%) purchase orders,
totaling $259,019, of the 42 did not include required information. These purchase orders did not
include a list of the drugs being purchased. The information on the purchase order was limited to
one generic catalog number with a line description called “adjustment.” For example, if 15
different drugs were ordered with a total price of $8,000, the purchase order would show “one”
under “quantity” and “$8,000” under “price.” While there is a detailed listing of drugs in the
Cardinal system, there is no detailed listing on the purchase orders; therefore there is no record
of the drugs purchased on OTPS.

> A review of the logbook showed that there were 243 purchase order numbers for purchase orders prepared
for the first quarter of the fiscal year; however, 21 of the purchase order numbers were not used for
purchases actually made during the first quarter of the fiscal year.

16 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_20
Discussions with the Director of the Pharmacy and the personnel assigned to perform
purchasing confirmed that this is the usual practice. They stated that this process was justified
since it expedited purchasing and eliminated the need to type all the drugs ordered on the
purchase orders.

In addition, there were instances in which noncontrolled drugs were ordered and received
in exchange for credit memos and for which no purchase order was created at all. When the
Pharmacy returns drugs to Cardinal, it receives credit memos to be used against future purchases.
However, we found that the Pharmacy “purchased” drugs using the credit memos but did not
prepare purchase orders for them, nor was there evidence that the “purchases” were authorized.
We reviewed all 94 credit memos, totaling $232,777, that were used to acquire drugs during the
period June 30, 2003, to December 31, 2003.° We found no evidence of approval or
authorization by the Director or Assistant Director indicating that these drugs should be acquired.

When we communicated our concerns to the Pharmacy Director, she told us that they
would correct the problem by using the credit memos to pay for items purchased via purchase
orders that are prepared through OTPS. We subsequently reviewed a purchase order that the
Director provided, which indicated that a credit was used against the purchase price. However,
the purchase order itself still lacked detail. As mentioned earlier, this purchase order did not
describe the drugs being purchased, but used",52838,7888

issue, and record","this case the credit amount was deducted from the purchase price.

By allowing drugs to be ordered before a purchase order is prepared, and by allowing

drugs to be acquired in exchange for credit memos without using a purchase order, the Pharmacy
is circumventing the controls put in place to ensure that only drugs that have been approved and
authorized will be ordered and purchased. Moreover, by not preparing the purchase order
properly or not using one at all, there is no record of what drugs were purchased on the OTPS
system nor can the drugs be accounted for. Again, this allows for the misappropriation of drugs
to occur without detection.

Unrestricted Access to the Pharmacy Stockroom

In addition to the weaknesses in the Pharmacy Department’s record-keeping, the
Pharmacy has inadequate controls to safeguard the inventory of noncontrolled drugs. It appears
that Pharmacy personnel not assigned to the stockroom have easy access to the stockroom and, in
fact, they very often filled their own orders and took noncontrolled drugs from the stockroom
shelves.

The Director of the Pharmacy Department provided us the names of eight stockroom
employees who were allowed access to the Pharmacy stockroom and were assigned to receive,

states:

“When an order for an item(s) is received from a distribution center (e.g., satellite), the
supervisor shall assign a storekeeper (other than the person receiving the drug, . . . to fill [the]

We conducted observations of stockroom operations for five days in March and April
2004*; we observed and documented 29 Pharmacy staff, who were not stockroom employees,

unauthorized persons take noncontrolled drugs from the shelves 20 different times during the
five day period. Further, these non-stockroom personnel did not submit issue sheets indicating
the authorization for the drug issuance and where the drugs were going.

According to HHC’s Operating Procedure No.140-1, Requisitioning Drugs and
Pharmaceuticals: “Supplies shall not be removed from the bulk stock or storage room under any
circumstances without a written request.” To determine whether issue sheets were submitted
after our observations, we reviewed all the issue sheets submitted for the days we conducted
observations. We could not find any issue sheets from those non-stockroom personnel who
removed noncontrolled drugs from the shelves during our observations.

The situation was made worse by the Pharmacy Department’s allowing stockroom

unauthorized personnel to enter the Pharmacy stockroom.

1. Institute and enforce proper internal controls over its inventory of noncontrolled
drugs maintained in the stockroom. The Pharmacy should: maintain its inventory of
noncontrolled drugs separate from the related inventory records; assign different
personnel to handle the drugs and to update the inventory records; and ensure that
only designated personnel have access to the stockroom.

HHC Response: “Bellevue has instituted internal controls over the inventory system. A
database was created to include all drugs and their respective costs. Bellevue will use the
OTPS system for its pharmacy perpetual inventory system, and staff assignments have
been segregated so that staff that handle the drugs are not involved in the update of the
computerized inventory records and vice versa.... Bellevue has implemented a card
access system to the 14"" floor Pharmacy Store Room that controls key doors in the area.
The card system records each entry and exit and that record is reviewed regularly by the
Pharmacy Director for any signs of inappropriate access. Access is also monitored by
newly installed close circuit cameras, with remote monitors located in both the Pharmacy
Director’s and Hospital Police offices... .”

2. Ensure that the Pharmacy Department maintains a computerized perpetual inventory
system for its inventory of noncontrolled drugs kept in the stockroom. The perpetual
inventory records should be kept separate from the physical inventory.

HHC Response: “As indicated in recommendation #1, Bellevue will use the OTPS
system as its perpetual inventory system",58712,8816

HHC Response: “As indicated in recommendation #1, Bellevue will use the OTPS
system as its perpetual inventory system in the Pharmacy. The records are stored in the
OTPS system, and as such, are kept separate from the physical inventory.”

3. Ensure that all receipts and issuances of drugs are appropriately recorded on the
inventory records.

HHC Response: “Bellevue has identified two Pharmacy Techs that are dedicated to
recording all receipts and issues of drugs in the OTPS perpetual inventory system. On[e]
Tech handles receipts and the other Tech handles issues consistent with the separation of
duties and responsibilities.”

4. Ensure that drugs are only issued by authorized personnel after submission of an
authorized issue sheet.

HHC Response: “A written policy has been issued to clarify how drugs are to be issued.
The staff that can authorize issue sheets and those who can issue drugs have been
identified and designated in the policy. The policy states that drugs cannot be issued
without the receipt of an authorized issue sheet.”

5. Investigate and document all discrepancies between the amount of inventory on hand
and the amount recorded.

HHC Response: “We intend to conduct monthly audits of sample drugs to compare the
amount on hand with the recorded amount in the inventory system. Any discrepancy
noted will be assigned to a supervisor for investigation, and entered into a logbook, set
aside for this purpose. ... The results of the investigation will be reported to the Director
or her designee, and any adjustment must be approved at that time. All records of the
discrepancy, investigation and adjustments will be stored and will be reviewed regularly
for any trends... .”

6. Ensure that adjustments to inventory records are documented, reviewed, and
approved by appropriate Pharmacy officials.

HHC Response: “Any adjustments will be documented and appropriately reviewed and
approved by the Pharmacy Director or her designee.”

7. Consider maintaining a log listing discrepancies and adjustments made to inventory
records. In this way, Pharmacy officials would have a better understanding of the
scope of discrepancies.

HHC Response: “A logbook of discrepancies and adjustments will be maintained.”

8. Ensure that drugs are purchased properly. Purchase orders should be prepared,
approved, and authorized before the drugs are ordered from the vendors; all ordered
drugs should be listed on the purchase order; and, credit memos should be properly
applied against purchases.

process. The purchase orders, sequentially generated by the OTPS system, are reviewed
by a supervisor to insure that they have been prepared correctly, that all drugs ordered are
properly itemized, and that any available credit memo is applied to the order as
watranted.”

9. Restrict access to the Pharmacy stockroom to authorized stockroom personnel.

HHC Response: “The Pharmacy Director reviewed all staff functions, and determined
who should have access to what areas during what days and times of the day. Only seven
(7) staff members were given card access to the stockroom, inclusive of three (3)
managers.”

10. Prohibit the removal of drugs from the stockroom shelves by any unauthorized
person.

checks the carts of personnel leaving the stockroom.”

Total Dollar Value of Noncontrolled Drugs Reported by
Bellevue Hospital May Be Misstated

HHC compiles the values of its facilities’ inventories so the total value can be accurately
reported in its financial statements. Based on our review, we estimate that the valuation of the
inventory of noncontrolled drugs as reported by Bellevue Hospital may have been misstated by
$1.6 million.

Bellevue Hospital is required to report to HHC the value of its drugs in stock at the end of
each fiscal year. To determine the value of the drugs, Bellevue Hospital staff conduct an
inventory count of all drugs stored in the Pharmacy stockroom and the Out Patient Pharmacy
Department at the end of the fiscal year. To assist in conducting the inventory count, the HHC
Office of Internal Audits distributed the Inventory Procedure Manual to Bellevue Hospital’s
Finance Department. This manual describes in detail the preparation and the procedures to
follow when conducting an inventory count.

The manual requires that either preprinted two-part tags or preprinted inventory lists

(count sheets) be used for the inventory count. The manual also requires that these tags and count
sheets “must be retained in the",63802,9595

## MG03_179A_page_25
This summary report","the Pharmacy stockroom on June 21,
2003. We found that Bellevue Hospital did not follow the procedures set forth in the manual.
First, the inventory records (inventory cards) were not sealed and removed from the Pharmacy
stockroom. In fact, the inventory records were inappropriately updated as part of the inventory
count process; second, the count sheets prepared for the inventory count were incomplete and did
not include many of the drugs in stock; and finally, the count sheets were removed from the
stockroom prior to HHC’s auditors’ verification of the inventory.

Bellevue Hospital had 12 teams counting the inventory. Each team used preprinted count
sheets to record the quantity on hand. While conducting the count, the teams inappropriately
updated the Pharmacy inventory cards. In addition, many of the drugs were not listed on the
count sheets and had to be manually recorded. As the count progressed, the teams found the
count sheets to be so deficient that the Assistant Director of Pharmacy distributed preprinted
issue sheets that listed many of the drugs stored in the stockroom. After the inventory count was
concluded these numerous sets of “count sheets” were submitted to the hospital’s Finance
Department. The Finance Department used all these count sheets and the price list from the
Pharmacy to prepare the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report, which is a detailed list of drugs in
inventory, their quantity, and their cost. The Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report is summarized.

21 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_25
This summary report is referred to as Exhibit H and includes the value of each of the hospital’s
inventories by category. Exhibit H is submitted to HHC to be used for its financial statements.
According to the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report, the total value of noncontrolled drugs in the
stockroom was $940,275.

To test the accuracy of the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report, we attempted to match the
drugs listed on the count sheets that we obtained from the Finance Department to the Fiscal Year
2003 Inventory Report. We found that the Finance Department did not accurately compile the
information from the count sheets to enter in the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report. Of the first
35 drugs we reviewed on the count sheets, 17 were not listed on the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory
Report; the other 18 drugs were listed with a zero quantity even though the count sheets showed
that there was a specific quantity in stock. We therefore determined that the Fiscal Year 2003
Inventory Report did not contain all of the noncontrolled drugs in the stockroom and that many
of the values shown were incorrect.

To determine the actual inventory and value of noncontrolled drugs in the stockroom, we
analyzed all the inventory cards for noncontrolled drugs and determined the balances as of June
21, 2003, the date of the Bellevue Hospital inventory count. Based on our review of the balances
recorded on the inventory cards and the price",67147,10134

Department using deficient","638,642 greater than the amount reported on the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report.
Specifically we found that:

e 285 of the drugs recorded on the inventory cards and valued at $634,185 were not on
the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report;

333 of the drugs recorded on the inventory cards and valued at $699,371 were
recorded on the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report with a zero quantity even though
the drugs were in stock;

949 of the drugs recorded on the inventory cards were listed on the Fiscal Year 2003
Inventory Report with either an incorrect quantity or price: 567 were understated by
a total of $591,063, and 382 were overstated by $264,924; and

14 of the drugs listed on the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report with a value of
$2,300 could not be verified because the inventory cards for the drugs as of June 21,
2003, could not be found.

There were 75 additional entries on the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report that had
quantities and values totaling $18,752; however, there were no matching inventory cards for
these items. According to Pharmacy officials, these 75 entries were incorrect and could have
been caused by duplicate or incorrect entries. There was no documentation to determine why
these errors occurred.

Based on our observations of Bellevue Hospital’s inventory count of the Pharmacy
stockroom, the inaccuracies of the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report compiled by the Finance

22 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_26
Department using deficient count sheets, and the Pharmacy’s inadequate record-keeping, it is
apparent that Bellevue Hospital disregarded the Inventory Procedures Manual and has allowed
erroneous financial information to be included in HHC financial statements.

Bellevue Hospital reported to HHC on Exhibit H the total value of inventory of
$4,186,827. Based on our review of the inventory cards, which Bellevue officials told us have
the most accurate inventory quantities, we estimate that the figures was incorrectly understated
by 39 percent. Based on the figures shown on the cards, Bellevue Hospital may not have
included approximately $1.6 million in inventory of noncontrolled drugs in its valuation of
inventory. As a result, we estimate that HHC’s financial statements for Fiscal Year 2003 may
also be understated by $1.6 million.

Recommendations
Bellevue Hospital officials should:

11. Ensure that when preparing and conducting the physical inventory count of drugs in
the Pharmacy, its staff follows the inventory count procedures outlined in the
Inventory Procedures Manual.

HHC Response: “We agree with recommendation #11, and implemented it for the FY
2004 year-end inventory valuation. The Pharmacy developed a list of all drugs with
accurate unit of measure and pricing that was used in the FY 2004 valuation.”

12. Ensure that all noncontrolled drugs stored in the Pharmacy stockroom are correctly
counted, and their total quantity and value correctly reported.

No Perpetual Inventory Records Maintained
In Central Supply Stores Stockrooms

Central Supply Stores does not maintain a perpetual inventory system for its medical and
surgical supplies; it does not keep perpetual records or even inventory cards as required by the
HHC Materials Management Inventory Procedures Manual. Therefore, Bellevue Hospital
cannot have an accurate account of the availability of the inventory, nor can it ensure that theft or
misappropriation of items would be detected.

Central Supply Stores maintains its medical and surgical supplies in two locations: the
14"" floor storeroom and the basement warehouse. The items and quantities are counted and the
values determined once a year when the staff conduct a physical inventory count. These amounts
are maintained as the inventory record until the next physical count the following year. Any

23 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_27
items purchased during the year are not added, nor are issued items deducted. Therefore,
between one fiscal year-end count to another, Bellevue Hospital does not know the actual
amount of inventory on hand or the value of that inventory. In Fiscal Year 2003, Bellevue
Hospital spent $8 million on medical and surgical supplies.

The HHC Material Management Inventory Procedures Manual requires either a manual
or an automated inventory system be used to maintain the inventory records. However, it
recommends the use of the automated system. If using a manual system, it states that each
department should maintain a stock card system that is updated daily. This updating requirement
also applies to the automated OTPS inventory system. The manual goes on to describe the
benefits of using an automated system, as follows:

“the automated system is capable of providing a facility with up-to-date on-hand
balance and usage history information on all its inventory items simultaneously. The
same information can be compiled using the manual system; however, this method is
more time consuming and prone to error.

“the automated system calculates on-hand balances as inventory transactions are
entered into the computer. These calculations are performed instantaneously and with
a higher degree of accuracy than if derived manually. Additionally, the automated
system calculates and stores the extension once an internal order is filled.

“the automated system provides a variety of reports which allows a facility to review
expeditiously its purchasing, inventory management and payment",72874,11069

After the completion","system was not used. However, he stated that Bellevue Hospital
was actively looking for a new computer system to keep track of the inventory. The need for an
effective inventory management system was made clear after we observed the large amounts of
medical and surgical supplies stored in the basement hallways (as discussed below). Such a
system would assist management by providing information on issuance volume and inventory
turnover, enabling management to determine whether goods are needed.

Since Central Supply Stores had no perpetual inventory records, we could not test the
accuracy of the inventory on hand. We tried to determine whether items that leave the
stockroom are properly recorded on issue sheets. We selected a random sample of 226 medical
and surgical items from a population of 1,045 (as listed in the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory
Report) and conducted an inventory count between August 7 and August 12, 2003. Using the
balances from the Central Stores physical count in June 2003, we attempted to deduct quantities
issued and add quantities received between the dates of the hospital’s physical count and our
physical count. We copied all the manual and Omnicell issue sheets from July 2, 2003, to August
12, 2003. However, we were not able to complete this test because the handwritten issue sheets
did not include the HHC catalog numbers, were incomplete, and in many cases illegible.
Therefore, we were not able to identify the inventory items accurately.

Medical and Surgical Supplies Not Secured Properly

During our visits to Bellevue Hospital’s basement warehouse, we observed that not all
the medical and surgical supplies were adequately safeguarded. Large quantities of medical and
surgical supplies were stored in the basement hallways at various distances from the stockroom,
near the public elevators and receiving docks. (See photographs one through five below.)
Moreover, many cases were broken open with items apparently missing or taken. Examples of
items stored in the hallway were face masks, surgical gloves, patient admission kits, and canes.

Bellevue Hospital officials stated that items are stored in the hallway because there was
not enough storage area in the locked storerooms. Improper safeguard for the medical and
surgical supplies and the absence of any inventory records cause the potential for theft and
misappropriation of items to occur and go undetected. It is Bellevue Hospital’s responsibility to
ensure that medical and surgical supplies are properly stored and safeguarded.

Recommendations
Bellevue Hospital should ensure that Central Supply Stores:

13. Maintains perpetual inventory records, preferably on a computerized inventory
system. Central Supply Stores should ensure that the persons updating the inventory
records are different from the persons handling the inventory; and access to the
inventory records should be restricted to designated personnel.

HHC Response: “A computerized perpetual inventory system is now in place. Staff
duties regarding inventory handling and record keeping have been segregated, and access
to the perpetual inventory records is restricted to designated personnel.”

14. Completes issue sheets properly. The issue sheets should include accurate catalog
numbers and description, so that they can be used to properly identify inventory items
removed from the storeroom.

HHC Response: “Issue sheets have been redesigned to include the catalog numbers and
product descriptions, and a space for the signature of an authorized official.”

15. Maintains all medical and surgical supplies in a locked and restricted area so that they
are properly safeguarded.

HHC Response: “Supplies are now kept in two areas, all of which have restricted access.
... Access to these two locations is restricted to a total of five (5) Materials Management
staff members... .”

Other Related Matters

HHC auditors from the Office of Internal Audits did not adequately perform the
inventory count verification at Bellevue Hospital’s Pharmacy and Central Supply Stores. They
did not verify the accuracy of the count sheets in the Pharmacy that were subsequently used to
prepare the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report, Exhibit",78722,11984

Other Related Matters

HHC auditors from the Office of Internal Audits did not adequately perform the
inventory count verification at Bellevue Hospital’s Pharmacy and Central Supply Stores. They
did not verify the accuracy of the count sheets in the Pharmacy that were subsequently used to
prepare the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory Report, Exhibit H, and HHC’s financial statements.
Instead, they inappropriately relied on the Pharmacy inventory cards kept next to the drugs. In
Central Supply Stores, the auditors inappropriately used the tags attached to the medical and
surgical supplies to verify the inventory. By not using the proper documents to verify the
inventory, the auditors did not uncover the inaccuracies, which allowed the value of
noncontrolled drugs to be understated and reportable conditions to remain unaddressed.

HHC Office of Internal Audits conducts a “limited scope review of the Corporation’s
annual physical inventory of pharmaceutical and medical/surgical supplies.” As stated in its
“letter report” on this review, the HHC auditors “assist the Corporation’s independent auditors
with the audit of HHC’s financial statements” by performing specific procedures “on a limited
test basis at each facility.” The procedures include assessing compliance with the Inventory
Procedures Manual, verifying the controls over inventory documents, reviewing inventory cut-

## MG03_179A_page_32
off procedures, determining whether inventory is safeguarded, and conducting physical test
counts of 10 or more items in the Pharmacy and medical and surgical supply storage areas. The
auditors compare their test count results to the facility’s count sheets and perpetual inventory
records for accuracy and completeness. If the HHC auditors’ count matches the facility’s count,
then the verification of inventory is complete, and HHC relies on this information in preparing its
financial statements. If there are differences between the auditors’ count and the hospital’s
records, additional items are selected to be counted.

As discussed previously in this report, the Inventory Procedures Manual requires that the
Pharmacy inventory records be sealed and not be accessible during the inventory count process.
In addition, count sheets “must be retained in the inventory area after the count has been
completed and until cleared by the [HHC] auditors.” Bellevue Hospital did not seal and remove
the inventory records from the Pharmacy stockroom. In fact, the inventory records were
inappropriately updated during the inventory count. Moreover, the count sheets were removed
from the stockroom before the HHC auditors’ verification of the inventory.

HHC auditors failed to comment on Bellevue Hospital’s obvious disregard to follow the
proper inventory procedures. They not only failed to acknowledge that the Pharmacy inventory
records were not sealed or removed from the stockroom as required, but the auditors also
inappropriately relied on these same inventory records to verify their physical count of 10",81522,12397

## MG03_179A_page_33
HHC Response: In","on preprinted count sheets and on inventory tags placed on each item. The HHC
Inventory Procedures Manual states: ““Two-part tags should be used for tagging the inventory”
and that the two-part tags should list the item’s location, description, number, unit description,
and the unit price. Bellevue Hospital failed to properly tag the inventory. One-part tags were
used, and the tags did not indicate item location and unit price; and many tags did not include the
item number. HHC auditors failed to comment on Central Supply Stores’ inadequate inventory
count procedures. Moreover, instead of using the count sheets to verify their physical count of
chosen items, the auditors used the quantity noted on the tags.

At the exit conference, HHC auditors stated that the Central Supply Stores had properly
used count sheets to record the physical inventory count and that the tags were just used to
indicate that the item had been counted. Although this may be the case, HHC auditors incorrectly
used these tags, not the count sheets, to verify the physical inventory. After discovering an error
in the count of one of the 10 items chosen from the medical and surgical supplies, the auditors
correctly chose an additional five items to count. They corrected the error on the tag, not on the
count sheet. Therefore, an incorrect count was used to prepare the Fiscal Year 2003 Inventory
Report, which is then used to support HHC financial statements.

29 Office of the New York City Comptroller William","William C. Thompson, Jr.


## MG03_179A_page_33
HHC Response: In his letter, the Assistant Vice President of the HHC Office of Internal
Audits stated: “The fact that Central Supply Stores utilized a one part tag rather than a
two part tag is insignificant. The tag totals were transcribed on to pre-printed count
sheets that included a description of the item, item number and unit price. The count
sheets were then utilized to value the year-end inventory. Therefore, verifying our
inventory count against the tag was an acceptable method because the count totals from
our sample were reconciled to Exhibit H subsequently submitted by the facility.”

Auditor Comments: As stated in this report and at the exit conference, the count team
recorded the results of the counts simultaneously on the one part tag and the count sheet.
After all items were counted, and before the HHC auditors performed their verification,
the count sheets were removed from the area. The count sheets, not the one part tag,
were used to prepare Exhibit H. Therefore, the count sheets should have been used by
HHC auditors for the verification. In fact, as we previously stated, on the day of the
verification, a correction to a count was made on the tag but not on the count sheet; and
since Exhibit H was prepared from the count sheets, it had the incorrect number. Even
though HHC auditors may have reconciled their sample to Exhibit H, as they stated, a
correction was not made to Exhibit H.",85293,13001

reviews, analyses","of Internal
Audits stated: “Our testing is not designed to provide absolute verification of a facility’s
inventory, or to serve as a substitute for a comprehensive audit. Rather, within a two-
week period, our testing seeks to provide assurance that a physical inventory was taken in
accordance with corporate policies at 21 corporate locations. . . . Lastly, your report
concludes that our limited non-statistically valid testing is what HHC relies upon in
preparing the inventory portion of the financial statements. However, this is not accurate.
In addition to our limited testing, HHC external auditors perform other reviews and
analyses to determine the reasonableness of the inventory valuations. Facilities also have
a series of checks and balances in place as part of their year end inventory process. It is
not the role of this office to value HHC’s inventory but to participate as part of a larger
operation to ensure reasonable inventory valuations.”

Auditor Comments: Although the verification of the inventory count performed by the
HHC auditors is not an “absolute verification,’ when it is performed properly and
according to the HHC Inventory Procedure Manual, it is an important step in providing
reasonable assurance of the accuracy of the inventory count and its valuation. This audit
found that the verification was not conducted according to the HHC Inventory
Procedures Manual. By failing to follow proper procedures, the HHC auditors may have
allowed the noncontrolled drugs to be grossly undervalued. Further, the series of

reviews, analyses, and checks and balances referred to by the Assistant Vice President,
did not succeed in detecting an error rate exceeding 150 percent. While, according to the
response letter, the Office of Internal Audit is not responsible for conducting the
inventory count but performs limited tests and operates as part of a larger operation, HHC
auditors are nevertheless responsible for performing their tasks properly and in
accordance with HHC procedures so as to provide reasonable assurance of the accuracy
of the inventory count and valuation.

Recommendations
Bellevue Hospital officials should:

16. Ensure that when preparing and conducting the physical inventory count of the
medical and surgical supplies, its staff follow the inventory count procedures outlined
in the Inventory Procedures Manual.

HHC Response: “Copies of the corporate Policy & Procedure that governs the conduct of
fiscal year-end inventory taking have been provided to the appropriate Bellevue staff.
The Accounting Director reviews the corporate Policy & Procedure annually with staff
that participate in the year-end inventory taking and valuation.”

HHC should:

17. Ensure that the HHC auditors comply with the Inventory Procedures Manual when
performing the annual inventory verification at the HHC facilities.

HHC Response: “We have retrained the staff in year-end inventory valuation procedures.

Dear Mr. Brooks:

We recognize and appreciate the time and energy that your staff put into preparing the audit report referenced
above and welcome the opportunity to respond to the findings, commentary and related recommendations, While we
agree with certain findings and disagree with the severity of others, we recognize the need for improvement cited in the
audit and implemented the majority of the recommendations, as noted in-the attached report.

It should be noted that, during the period of the audit, the Accounting Department elected to use a new
database developed by finance staff to compile the year-end inventory valuation instead of using spreadsheets as had
been done in years past. The accounting staff were given training on how to use the database but had difReulty in
_ updating the master inventory list table in part duc to the design of the database itself and in part due to their lack of.

experience with database programs. This resulted in the findings in the audit that certain drugs were included without
quantities and that many drugs had incorrect quantities or prices.

However, as a result of the audit and the extensive corrective action plans implemented a year ago and
described on the following pages, the process for the year-end inventory in fiscal year 2004 was preatly improved. We
will continue to build upon these improvements and monitor the internal controls put in place over not-controlled

drugs and medical/surgical supplies going forward.

As discussed with the auditors during the audit, the Pharmacy Department has begun using the OTPS
system to manage","manage its inventory. Computer hardware dedicated for the system was installed and two
staff members were specifically assigned the tasks of inputting data. A new inventory was
conducted, and starting balances were entered in the system. Once staff have completed updating the

they will update the inventory for each drug to reflect the receipts and issuances made since the
Starting balances were established, Pharmacy expects to complete this process by the end of this
fiscal year (June 2005). Since the OTPS system stores a computerized inventory, the inventory
record is separate and apart from all other related inventory records. Assignments of staff have been
Segregated, so that staff that handles the drugs are not involved in the update of the computerized
inventory records, and vice versa.

Access to the stock room was analyzed and restricted to necessary personnel. Only seven (7) staff
members have access to the stock room, inclusive of three (3) managers. The restricted access is
enforced by a newly installed card access system that controls key doors in the area, including the
stockroom. The system requires a programmable chip, issued only by Hospital Police, to enter and
exit a room or area protected by the system. The Pharmacy Director reviewed all staff functions, and
determined who should have access to what areas during what days and times of the day. That
information was relayed to Hospital Police, which then programmed each individual chip

recommendations contained in this letter should be considered preliminary; I recommend a more
in-depth review be undertaken at the appropriate time to build upon our analysis.

To review a related matter of the City’s preparedness for this crisis, I have recently requested
from the City the records necessary to conduct a thorough investigation into decision making
within New York City government leading up to, and during, the pandemic. This investigation,
when completed, will provide an in-depth analysis of the successes and shortcomings in the
City’s response to the pandemic, and may contain findings that confirm or revise the findings of
this initial review.

COVID-19 has devastated New York City, claiming more than 22,000 lives as of mid-June. The
pandemic quickly placed extreme stress on New York City’s healthcare systems — including, but
not exclusively, H+H. Years of planning for the next pandemic and early action to obtain
necessary resources could not meet the challenge of this health crisis. This review found that
H+H, and the larger system within which it has operated during the pandemic, faced an
unprecedented situation for which no one was fully prepared. The lack of preparedness forced all
players to improvise responses, sometimes successfully, sometimes not — but inevitably at a cost
in human lives. Several deficiencies were noted, including inadequate access to needed supplies
and equipment, a lack of systems and procedures for managing","managing patient loads across hospitals,
and insufficient protocols for deploying staff.

communities: people living in lower-income neighborhoods, people of color, and those with
underlying health conditions have been more likely to die from the virus. These are the
communities that rely on H+H for care. A history of disinvestment in healthcare in those same
communities further increased the burden of care on H+H hospitals. Certain operational
deficiencies we identified can be addressed in the short term, but the deeper problem of
inequitable access to healthcare must be considered equally urgent, even though it will take more
time and resources to address.

H+H Serves a Population Disproportionately Impacted by COVID-19

COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted New York City’s lower-income communities of
color, a large component of the population H+H serves. For example, as of mid-May, the
age-adjusted death rate was twice as high for Black and Hispanic New Yorkers than for the
City’s white and Asian population. H+H’s outsized role in providing care to these vulnerable
City residents most severely impacted by COVID-19 is frustrated by its lack of resources and
financing.

In FY 2018, H+H facilities served 1",2148,359

Brooklyn.

As a public hospital system, H+H","emergency room visits in 2018.

Busy does not translate to being seen promptly. H+H EDs perform relatively poorly on measures
of strain in the emergency room, e.g., how long it takes for patients to be seen, receive
medication, and be admitted or discharged. For example, at Elmhurst Hospital, patients must
wait on average more than four hours before being sent home from the emergency room, if not
admitted, and more than 11 hours to be admitted. At both Kings County Hospital and Jacobi
Medical Center, the average wait to be admitted is more than 12 hours. Across New York State,
the average wait to be admitted from the emergency room is approximately six hours and the
average wait to be discharged, if not admitted, is less than three hours.


## 7.17.20-HH-Response-to-COVID-19.docx_page_3
H+H EDs are busy in part because they often serve larger surrounding areas, called “catchment
areas,” than private hospitals. Elmhurst Hospital, for example, serves a catchment area of
372,000 New Yorkers, compared to 127,000 for NYU Langone and 174,000 on average
citywide. The reliance on the City’s public hospital system to meet the needs of communities
without choices in healthcare has grown with hospital closures and downsizings that have
resulted in about 20,000 fewer hospital beds in New York State since 2000. In the last 2 decades,
at least 16 hospitals in New York City have closed, including four in Queens and three in
Brooklyn","Brooklyn.

As a public hospital system, H+H’s mission is to treat those individuals unable to pay for
medical care. In FY 2019, about one-third of the approximately 1.1 million unique in- and
out-patients served at H+H facilities were uninsured. About 70 percent of H+H patients are
insured by Medicaid or have no insurance, compared to 40 percent for private (“voluntary”)
hospitals in New York City. As of the beginning of FY 2020, revenues from patient insurance or
payments covered just 61 percent of H+H’s expenses; the balance was provided by public
subsidies. In the first four months of FY 2020, after falling in recent years, the number of
uninsured H+H patients rose by 8 percent. Public subsidies fill the H+H budget gaps that are
caused by the number of uninsured and Medicaid patients it treats.

Among the most important sources of public funding are Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)
payments, which are Medicaid funds intended to aid hospitals that suffer financial losses from
providing care to relatively large numbers of uninsured and Medicaid patients, and Upper
Payment Limit (UPL) funds, which are Medicaid funds to cover some of the difference in
reimbursement rates between Medicaid and Medicare. These funds account for more than 20
percent of H+H revenues. While H+H is lowest in the hierarchy of recipients of DSH funding,
in City Fiscal Year 2020 H+H received over one-third of total statewide DSH resources ($3.7

citywide. The reliance on the City’s public hospital system to meet the needs of communities
without choices in healthcare has grown with hospital closures and downsizings that have
resulted in about 20,000 fewer hospital beds in New York State since 2000. In the last 2 decades,
at least 16 hospitals in New York City have closed, including four in Queens and three in
Brooklyn.

As a public hospital system, H+H’s mission is to treat those individuals unable to pay for
medical care. In FY 2019, about one-third of the approximately 1.1 million unique in- and
out-patients served at H+H facilities were uninsured. About 70 percent of H+H patients are
insured by Medicaid or have no insurance, compared to 40 percent for private (“voluntary”)
hospitals in New York City. As of the beginning of FY 2020, revenues from patient insurance or
payments covered just 61 percent of H+H’s expenses; the balance was provided by public
subsidies. In the first four months of FY 2020, after falling in recent years, the number of
uninsured H+H patients rose by 8 percent. Public subsidies fill the H+H budget gaps that are
caused by the number of uninsured and Medicaid","Medicaid patients it treats.

Among the most important sources of public funding are Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)
payments, which are Medicaid funds intended to aid hospitals that suffer financial losses from
providing care to relatively large numbers of uninsured and Medicaid patients, and Upper
Payment Limit (UPL) funds, which are Medicaid funds to cover some of the difference in
reimbursement rates between Medicaid and Medicare. These funds account for more than 20
percent of H+H revenues. While H+H is lowest in the hierarchy of recipients of DSH funding,
in City Fiscal Year 2020 H+H received over one-third of total statewide DSH resources ($3.7
billion), including $600 million in Inpatient and Outpatient UPL payments for FY20 and prior
years. H+H is the only hospital that receives inpatient UPL payments.

The adopted state budget for state fiscal year 2020-21 included $2.2 billion in annual cuts against
baseline Medicaid growth that could affect H+H’s bottom line. Changes in the DSH distribution
formula that reduced funding for better-off hospitals, however, are expected to provide roughly
$100 million in additional DSH funding to H+H (which will require the City to fund half). The

In July 2006, the City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) published

problems the City faced during the COVID-19 pandemic nearly 14 years later. Among other
things, the Plan cautioned that, since the pandemic would be expected to be widespread in the
United States, supplies from the federal Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) might not be
available and local caches would need to provide necessary supplies. The Plan identified
problems that would likely occur, such as hospitals not being able to transfer potentially
contagious cases/patients, functioning at full capacity, and lacking adequate critical care
capacity. The Plan also anticipated",8559,1453

including staff, supplies, and systems","current and ongoing health care
expenses.” It also predicted that since “... severe staffing shortages are anticipated...purchasing
additional ventilators beyond a threshold will not save additional lives, because there will not be
a sufficient number of trained staff to operate them.” It further warned that “[i]n the event of an
overwhelming burden on the health care system, New York will not have sufficient ventilators to
meet critical care needs despite its emergency stockpile” of 1,750 ventilators. This quantity was
not sufficient for “the most severe model,” and the State had no plans to buy enough ventilators
for the most severe model.

The gap between planning and reality is no doubt due to several factors, including the large and
abrupt scale of the COVID-19 pandemic. Planning and preparedness fell short in the current
instance in part because institutions — the State, the City, H+H, and private hospitals — faced
resource tradeoffs between the cost of preparing for a possible future scenario and the daily
reality of care delivery. The lack of preparedness forced all players to improvise responses,
sometimes successfully, sometimes not—but inevitably at a cost in human lives.

How H+H Pivoted to Address the Four Aspects of Emergency Preparedness: Space, Staff,
Stuff, and Systems

Preparing for—and meeting—the needs raised by a public health emergency require addressing
the “four S’s” of emergency planning: space, staff, stuff, and systems. Adding beds — space — to
any health care system also requires the additional resources to support and manage","manage those beds,
including staff, supplies, and systems to coordinate the fulfillment of those needs among the
various facilities, whether within one healthcare organization or between different organizations.

Space

Prior to the pandemic, on a typical day about half of H+H’s hospital beds were empty. However,
capacity quickly became a crucial issue as the number of beds, and particularly ICU beds, were
insufficient to meet the needs of the pandemic.

On March 16, 2020, the State created a council to coordinate and develop surge capacity at all
hospitals, with a target of 9,000 additional beds. On March 22, 2020, with the ultimate goal of
doubling capacity, the State ordered all hospitals to increase bed capacity by at least 50 percent.
H+H announced plans to add 2,466 standard hospital beds and 762 ICU beds, which would triple
the number of pre-pandemic ICU beds, by May 1. Additionally, H+H also planned to add 350
temporary beds at Coler Specialty Hospital on Roosevelt Island. As a result of the state order,
within a month of the outbreak, statewide hospital capacity nearly doubled, expanding from
53,000 to 90,000 beds, including the addition of hotels, field hospitals, temporary converted
spaces, and the USNS Comfort. Ultimately capacity was added to a degree that it was not fully
needed.

Staff

The surge of patients and addition of beds at H+H hospitals required additional personnel,
including both medical professionals and support staff needed to provide care.

required systems and coordination to manage the surge of patients, for example, to","supplies, rather than by science and medical standards. In
February the CDC issued guidelines that were inconsistent with previous medical standards of
care and approved limited re-use of PPE. For example, a N95 mask that previously had to be
changed after each procedure or patient exam could now be used for up to five days. The State
Department of Health disseminated the CDC guidelines, despite their obvious deficiencies, and
H+H and other hospitals followed them: the lack of sufficient supplies precluded them from
following more medically sound standards.

The changing guidance and ensuing confusion rendered H+H health care workers even more
vulnerable to COVID-19, with many becoming sick and dying. The New York State Nurses
Association reported that as of early June at least 35 of its members had died. Such risk is not
limited to the health professionals directly interacting with patients. For example, lab technicians
reported a lack of equipment required to safely perform their work, specifically a “bio-hazard
hood” needed to examine blood samples. In addition, the reported transfer of COVID-19 samples
by pneumatic chute along with other blood samples could spread COVID-19 contamination to
non-COVID-19 units and expose laboratory workers. Finally, according to reports my office
received, even supplies to clean patient rooms were inadequate, creating a risk of infection to
other patients and hospital personnel.

Systems

The expansion of hospital beds, transfer or addition of personnel, and requisition of supplies each
required systems and coordination to manage","manage the surge of patients, for example, to effectuate the
transfer of patients at crowded hospital to available beds at one with available capacity. At the
outset of the crisis, the existing systems were not equipped to handle the need and volume.

On January 21"", more than a week before the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern, H+H virtually activated its Central Office of Emergency
Management Emergency Operations Center. Two weeks later, on February 3, 2020, H+H
established a “Tiger Team,” including subject matter experts from various departments who meet

Similarly, procurement and distribution of PPE was eventually centrally managed","managed, with support
provided by the City DOHMH. In late March, DOHMH began weekly distribution of PPE from
its warehouse to all hospitals (H+H and _ private). DOHMH also fulfills emergency
requests—within 24 hours if possible—through a 1-800 phone number.

On a broader level, the management of patient loads across different hospitals and systems also
shifted from an ad hoc arrangement to a more centralized system with the creation of a central
State-level coordinating body jointly managed by the Greater New York Hospital Association
and Northwell Health on behalf of the State. The State activated the existing Healthcare
Evacuation Coordination Center (HECC), which has been used in prior emergencies to
coordinate patient transfers, but only for the purpose of facilitating transfer of non-COVID
patients from hospitals to the temporary field hospital established at the Javits Center.
Operations were later transferred to Northwell Health.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that while planning is important, even the best plans
inevitably will not and cannot foresee or anticipate every eventuality, because each emergency
and crisis is unique. COVID-19 presented an unprecedented challenge and placed strains on
every part of the City’s healthcare system, both private and public. Planning and preparedness
must provide for a clear chain of command and responsibility to ensure a coordinated, timely,
and effective response and allow for the flexibility that our preliminary inquiry identified.

The surge of patients requiring medical treatment at an H+H hospital was uneven across the
H+H system, as press accounts about issues confronted by Elmhurst Hospital revealed. In an
effort to address the disparities between the demand at each facility and its available resources,
individual H+H staff would telephone another facility to attempt a transfer. As this informal
process became untenable under the pressure of surging caseloads, it was replaced by a daily
conference call and ultimately an email portal that allowed users to view need and capacity at
H-+H facilities and request transfers centrally.

Similarly, procurement and distribution of PPE was eventually centrally managed, with support
provided by the City DOHMH. In late March, DOHMH began weekly distribution of PPE from
its warehouse to all hospitals (H+H and _ private). DOHMH also fulfills emergency
requests—within 24 hours if possible—through a 1-800 phone number.

On a broader level, the management of patient loads across different hospitals and systems also
shifted from an ad hoc arrangement to a more centralized system with the creation of a central
State-level coordinating body jointly managed","managed by the Greater New York Hospital Association
and Northwell Health on behalf of the State. The State activated the existing Healthcare
Evacuation Coordination Center (HECC), which has been used in prior emergencies to
coordinate patient transfers, but only for the purpose of facilitating transfer of non-COVID
patients from hospitals to the temporary field hospital established at the Javits Center.
Operations were later transferred to Northwell Health.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that while planning is important, even the best plans
inevitably will not and cannot foresee or anticipate every eventuality, because each emergency
and crisis is unique. COVID-19 presented an unprecedented challenge and placed strains on
every part of the City’s healthcare system, both private and public. Planning and preparedness
must provide for a clear chain of command and responsibility to ensure a coordinated, timely,
and effective response and allow for the flexibility that our preliminary inquiry identified.

It is clear that H+H—or any individual healthcare system—cannot manage the need created by a
health crisis of the magnitude experienced with COVID-19 in isolation and without support and
assistance from state and local governments acting in concert with the entire healthcare delivery
sector. H+H’s challenges arose at least in part from insufficient and conflicting guidance,
originating at the federal level, and an initial lack of coordination among participants in the local
healthcare system. Many of these challenges were addressed “on the fly” by both the State and

Develop a plan to identify and obtain critical supplies in advance of the next health crisis.
Such a plan must assume contingencies for a lack of critical supplies or the assistance of
the federal government. Providers of critical equipment should be identified in advance
and the State and City health departments should work in concert with hospital systems to
put in place contingency contracts to ensure supplies are available when and as needed.
A centralized inventory and procurement system for key equipment and supplies should
be created to manage","manage surges that exceed the capacity of individual hospitals to meet.

Review and formalize innovations created to address the COVID-19 pandemic as
standard operating procedures (SOP), including the enhancement of coordination within
H+H facilities and both between and among different health care systems. For example,
the mechanisms developed for the transfer of patients between and among H+H facilities
as well as other healthcare systems should be formalized and made permanent.
Contingencies for supply management in the event of excess demand should also be
institutionalized.

At the same time, there were practices and protocols that must be examined more closely by
H+H leadership and improved if a future large-scale health emergency is to be handled more
effectively. I further recommend that:

4. As part of regularly conducted pandemic drills and exercises, H+H doctors and nurses

5.

should be cross-trained to support ICU and critical care staff.

Any transferred or volunteer personnel be provided with sufficient training or shadowing
opportunities to obtain the requisite knowledge to perform new duties or duties they have
not performed in a significant period of time. Appropriate training could consist of
shadowing an experienced staff member who currently performs the function to be
assumed or even classroom learning. Transferred staff might also need to be given access
to and trained on any computer systems or databases needed to perform the new duties
that they have not previously used.

To the Citizens of the City of New York

Ladies and Gentlemen:

In accordance with the Comptroller’s responsibilities contained in Chapter 5, § 93, of the New
York City Charter, my office has examined inventory controls over noncontrolled drugs at
Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn.

Located in Brooklyn, Coney Island Hospital is one of the New York City Health and Hospitals
Corporation’s (HHC) 11 acute-care hospitals that provide medical, mental health, and substance-
abuse services to City residents—regardless of their ability to pay. Audits such as this provide a
means of ensuring that City hospitals maintain adequate internal controls over inventory to
properly safeguard assets, thereby reducing the risk of misappropriation and theft.

The results of our audit, which are presented in this report, have been discussed with HHC and
Coney","Coney Island Hospital officials, and their comments have been considered in the preparation of
this report. Their complete written response is attached to this report as an addendum.

I trust that this report contains information that is of interest to you. If you have any questions

Hospital purchases, stores, and dispenses noncontrolled drugs. To maintain inventory records, it

inventory as $883,394 at Fiscal Year-end 2007.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

We determined that Coney Island Hospital had inadequate internal controls over its
pharmacy stockroom inventory of noncontrolled drugs in Fiscal Year 2007. As a result, we
questioned the disposition of an estimated $3.75 million of noncontrolled drugs related to inventory
“adjustments.” After discussing these findings and newly implemented Hospital procedures with
the Hospital and HHC, we conducted additional testing at the end of Fiscal Year 2008 and
determined that during that period, the hospital had improved its inventory controls and generally
maintained accurate perpetual inventory records.

However, the audit revealed that during Fiscal Year 2007, Coney Island Hospital did not
maintain accurate perpetual inventory records, lacked an independent review of transactions
entered into OTPS, and did not take corrective actions or document explanations when inventory

Audit Report on
Inventory Controls over Noncontrolled Drugs at
Coney Island Hospital

MG07-111A

AUDIT REPORT IN BRIEF

The audit determined whether Coney Island Hospital had adequate internal controls over
its pharmacy stockroom inventory of noncontrolled drugs.

As part of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC), Coney Island
Hospital purchases, stores, and dispenses noncontrolled drugs. To maintain inventory records, it
is responsible for maintaining its perpetual inventory records for noncontrolled drugs kept in its
pharmacy stockroom on the HHC computerized OTPS (Other Than Personal Services)
procurement management system. During Fiscal Year 2007, Coney","Coney Island Hospital spent
approximately $13 million for controlled and noncontrolled drugs and reported the value of its drug
inventory as $883,394 at Fiscal Year-end 2007.

Audit Findings and Conclusions

We determined that Coney Island Hospital had inadequate internal controls over its
pharmacy stockroom inventory of noncontrolled drugs in Fiscal Year 2007. As a result, we
questioned the disposition of an estimated $3.75 million of noncontrolled drugs related to inventory
“adjustments.” After discussing these findings and newly implemented Hospital procedures with
the Hospital and HHC, we conducted additional testing at the end of Fiscal Year 2008 and
determined that during that period, the hospital had improved its inventory controls and generally
maintained accurate perpetual inventory records.

However, the audit revealed that during Fiscal Year 2007, Coney Island Hospital did not
maintain accurate perpetual inventory records, lacked an independent review of transactions
entered into OTPS, and did not take corrective actions or document explanations when inventory
discrepancies between actual (stockroom) and perpetual (OTPS) inventory were identified. In
addition, pharmacy staff made unsubstantiated inventory adjustments on several occasions,
totaling an estimated $3.75 million, to the noncontrolled drug perpetual inventory in OTPS to
align it with physical balances at the hospital and yet still had discrepancies in 50 percent of the
items at fiscal year-end. The hospital later reported to us that it conducted an analysis of the
adjustments and determined that $2.90 million was related to inventory issuances that had not

At Coney","Coney Island Hospital, the facility covered by this audit, noncontrolled drugs are
stored in secure areas and are monitored 24 hours a day by security cameras. The noncontrolled
drugs for the pharmacy’s stockroom are ordered by pharmacy managers. Vendors deliver orders
directly to the pharmacy’s stockroom, along with invoices, where staff receive and check each
shipment for accuracy. Invoices are entered into OTPS to make payments to vendors and to
automatically add items received to the hospital’s noncontrolled drug perpetual inventory records.

Noncontrolled drugs are issued from the pharmacy stockroom to five pharmacy units’
within the hospital based upon written requests, called issue sheets. Drugs requested on issue
sheets are assembled by stockroom staff. Upon delivery to each unit, issue sheets are reviewed
and verified by unit supervisors. Then, these verified issue sheets are entered into OTPS by
stockroom staff to update the hospital’s perpetual inventory records. Invoices and issue sheets
are filed in the pharmacy department.

Each hospital must report the value of its year-end drug inventory through HHC. During
Fiscal Year 2007, Coney Island Hospital spent approximately $13 million for controlled and

Objective

The objective of this audit was to determine whether Coney Island Hospital has adequate
internal controls over its pharmacy stockroom inventory of noncontrolled drugs.

Scope and Methodology

The scope of this audit is Fiscal Years 2007 and 2008. To gain an understanding of the
inventory controls over noncontrolled drugs at Coney Island Hospital, we reviewed the hospital’s
policy and procedures related to drug inventory: PHA-119, “Requisitioning Pharmaceuticals and
Supplies by the Various Pharmacy Areas from the Main Pharmacy Stockroom”; PHA-160,
“Store Room [stockroom] Audit”; PHA-167, “Receiving of Pharmacy Supplies in E-Commerce
and OTPS”; PHA-166, “Purchasing Pharmaceuticals and Supplies using the E-Commerce and
OTPS System”; and PHA-164, “Adjustments to the OTPS Pharmacy Inventory.” We
interviewed Coney Island Hospital officials and conducted walk-throughs of the physical space,
as well as its processes for the purchase, maintenance, and dispensing of noncontrolled drugs.
We reviewed documents related to the pharmacy’s drug inventory, including internal audit
reports. We used Comptroller’s Directive #1, Principals of Internal Control as additional criteria
for assessing internal controls.

At Coney Island Hospital, the facility covered by this audit, noncontrolled drugs are
stored in secure areas and are monitored 24 hours a day by security cameras. The noncontrolled
drugs for the pharmacy’s stockroom are ordered by pharmacy managers. Vendors deliver orders
directly to the pharmacy’s stockroom, along with invoices, where staff receive and check each
shipment for accuracy. Invoices are entered into OTPS to make payments to vendors and to
automatically add items received to the hospital’s noncontrolled drug perpetual inventory records.

Noncontrolled drugs are issued from the pharmacy stockroom to five pharmacy units’
within the hospital based upon written requests, called issue sheets. Drugs requested on issue
sheets are assembled by stockroom staff. Upon delivery to each unit, issue sheets are reviewed
and verified by unit supervisors. Then, these verified issue sheets are entered into OTPS by
stockroom staff to update the hospital’s perpetual inventory records. Invoices and issue sheets
are filed in the pharmacy department.

Each hospital must report the value of its year-end drug inventory through HHC. During
Fiscal Year 2007, Coney Island Hospital spent approximately $13 million for controlled and
noncontrolled drugs and reported the value of its drug inventory as $883,394 at Fiscal Year-end 2007.

inventory controls over its pharmacy stockroom inventory of noncontrolled drugs.

The audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards (GAGAS) and included tests of records and other auditing procedures considered
necessary. This audit was performed in accordance with the City Comptroller’s audit
responsibilities as set forth in Chapter 5, §93, of the New York City Charter.

Discussion of Audit Results

The matters covered in this report were discussed with HHC and Coney","Coney Island Hospital
officials during, and at the conclusion of this audit. A preliminary draft report was sent to HHC
and Coney Island Hospital officials on February 4, 2009, and was discussed at an exit conference
on February 24, 2009. A draft report was submitted to HHC and Coney Island Hospital officials

on April 1, 2009, with a request for comments. We received a written response from HHC on
April 27, 2009.

In its response, HHC agreed with the audit’s recommendations. However, the agency
disagreed with the tone of the report. HHC stated: “While we agree with certain findings and
disagree with the reported severity of others, we recognize the need for improvement. With
respect to the deficiencies cited in your audit regarding pharmacy inventory controls for Fiscal
Year 2007, and those identified in CIH’s [Coney Island Hospital’s] internal review, corrective
measures were already being initiated prior to the start of your FY 2007 and FY 2008 audits.
In addition, a number of operating procedures and processes were developed to strengthen and
enhance internal controls over the facility’s noncontrolled drug inventory.” A careful review of
HHC’s disagreements found them to be without merit.

HHC Response: “In November 2008, representatives from HHC’s Office of Internal
Audits and the facility met with the audit team to present results of the Pharmacy
Department’s analysis. We identified supporting documentation [issue sheets] for
$2.9 million of the $3.75 million claimed as “unsubstantiated”. Therefore, to continue to
represent that the $3.75 million is “unsubstantiated,” and that the facility did not provide
sufficient information to determine the accuracy of the analysis is inaccurate. The statement
surrounding the lack of information should be removed from the report, and the $3.75 million
should be modified/reduced to reflect recognition of documentation totaling $2.9 million,
together with the exclusion of an additional $110,000 of non-pharmaceutical items.

Auditor Comment: We state that $3.75 million in adjustments were “unsubstantiated”
because neither the facility, nor HHC provided the auditors with any documentation until
more than a year later, though it was requested from the facility as early as October 2007.
Furthermore, we were unable to determine the accuracy of the analysis that finally was
provided to us in November 2008. The facility is supposed to keep an explanation or
documentation on file for each specific adjustment made in OTPS. We agree that the

analysis based upon the issue sheets we obtained. In addition, even with their extensive
analysis, the facility still cannot explain some adjustments made during Fiscal Year 2007
that reduced the perpetual inventory levels for noncontrolled drug items in OTPS by
approximately $0.85 million. As stated earlier, all non-pharmaceutical items have
already been excluded from the $3.75 million in unsubstantiated adjustments.

Inaccurate and Incomplete Inventory Records

Physical inventory counts showed that the noncontrolled drug perpetual inventory in
OTPS was not accurate nor complete compared to the actual balances of noncontrolled drugs in
the pharmacy stockroom at Coney","Coney Island Hospital. We found discrepancies in the counts for as
many as 59 percent of the noncontrolled drugs reviewed (the error rate), despite millions of
dollars in mostly inadequately documented adjustments that hospital officials said had been
made in order to align the inventory records with the physical balances at the hospital. The large
number and size of discrepancies lead us to conclude that limited reliance can be placed on the
hospital’s inventory records. In addition, these discrepancies may have been indicative of a
larger problem, such as theft or mismanagement, at the stockroom.

HHC Response: HHC objects to the statement “discrepancies may have been indicative of a
larger problem such as theft or mismanagement;” rather HHC “attributes the discrepancies to
the following: instances where the new E-Commerce procurement system did not interface
appropriately with the Pharmacy Department’s OTPS system; inconsistencies in units of

could reduce these errors.

The results of the hospital’s complete Fiscal Year-end 2007 inventory count, one week

During the audit, hospital officials informed us that they had made changes to the
inventory process to improve record-keeping since the Fiscal Year 2007 inventory adjustments in
OTPS. These changes included replacing and training new stockroom staffers, requiring more
timely data entry of invoices and issue sheets, and conducting drug-inventory spot checks.
However, officials were unable to adequately explain the reasons for the large number and size of
discrepancies identified in the year-end count. These discrepancies are even more disturbing in light
of the unsubstantiated inventory gross adjustments totaling $3.41 million that officials made to OTPS
prior to the year-end count. Following the count, the hospital made additional gross adjustments
of approximately $0.34 million, which were also unsubstantiated, for a total of $3.75 million.

prior to the year-end count. Following the count, the hospital made additional gross adjustments

(This issue is discussed in more detail in the following section of this report.) Taking this into

such as theft or mismanagement, at the stockroom.

We shared the results of our analysis with hospital and HHC officials in November 2007
and January 2008. The hospital pharmacy undertook an extensive analysis of the $3.75 million in
unsubstantiated inventory gross adjustments of noncontrolled drugs, consisting of approximately
$0.16 million in additions and $3.59 million in reductions, resulting in a net reduction of $3.43 million.
The hospital attempted to account for the shortages in inventory by identifying issue sheets which
may not have been entered into OTPS. In November 2008, the hospital reported its findings to us,
claiming that based upon its analysis, it had identified about $2.90 million of inventory that had
been issued from the storeroom but had not been entered into OTPS during Fiscal Year 2007.
Even with its analysis, the hospital still provided no explanation for approximately $0.85 million of
the inventory adjustments. In addition, the hospital did not provide sufficient information for us to
determine the accuracy of its analysis.

Inventory Management Problems

In Fiscal Year 2007, Coney","Coney Island Hospital management failed to institute proper
controls over its non-controlled drug inventory operations. As a result, it was unable to ensure
that waste and mismanagement of inventory are minimized and that inventory is effectively
protected against theft.

## MG07_111A_page_14
Hospital officials told us that they became aware of inventory problems in January 2007.
The hospital has an Internal Audit Department that reports to its Chief Financial Officer. A
hospital internal auditor performed a review of pharmacy inventory of noncontrolled drugs
on January 18, 2007. In the report, dated January 31, 2007, it was noted that the inventory level
decreased by $1.08 million, from $3.23 million to $2.15 million, on the date of the review.
According to the report, a pharmacy official stated that “issues were not entered in the system,
but rather inventory levels were adjusted to physical count values.” Our review of OTPS
records confirmed that pharmacy staff had “adjusted” inventory levels downwards by $2.3 million,
without adequate explanation and documentation, on January 17 and 18, 2007.

The hospital report warned that there was “no viable method of determining what percentage
of the inventory was used for patients or what percentage was lost due to theft.” It recommended
that the pharmacy must enter all drug invoices and issue sheets into OTPS on a regular basis,

Hospital officials told us that they became aware of inventory problems in January 2007.
The hospital has an Internal Audit Department that reports to its Chief Financial Officer. A
hospital internal auditor performed a review of pharmacy inventory of noncontrolled drugs
on January 18, 2007. In the report, dated January 31, 2007, it was noted that the inventory level
decreased by $1.08 million, from $3.23 million to $2.15 million, on the date of the review.
According to the report, a pharmacy official stated that “issues were not entered in the system,

to validate this audit finding. In fact, we were advised that the auditors’ conclusion was
based solely upon",33188,4971

## MG07_111A_page_15
and issue sheets","we had identified, and the facility verified, a total of $3.84 million in
inventory adjustments, but the pharmacy did not give the audit team any written
documentation supporting these adjustments. In January 2008, we met with HHC
officials, who subsequently met with the facility, and determined that the facility needed
to do an analysis to explain these adjustments. Finally, in November 2008, HHC officials
and the facility met with the audit team to present results of the Pharmacy Department’s
analysis related to the inventory adjustments.

In January 2007, the hospital updated existing and issued new written policies for the handling
of drugs and drug inventory. In addition, security measures were improved. By March 2007, a new
security system including key cards and cameras was installed in the pharmacy areas. However,
officials did not put adequate controls in place to ensure that inventory policies were being followed.

The hospital issued a policy requiring monthly drug inventory audits by the pharmacy staff,
in which “items to be chosen will be those pharmaceuticals that are either high cost/high volume or
high potential for diversion ... and all discrepancies must be reported and resolved the same day.”
We found that during Fiscal Year 2007 these audits were not being conducted monthly, as required.

The policy further states that the assistant director of pharmacy or his designee must also
check the invoices and issue sheets entered into OTPS at least once a month. Had the invoices

## MG07_111A_page_15
and issue sheets been reviewed and compared to OTPS entries each month, as required, the
unexplained discrepancies, which resulted in millions of dollars in unsubstantiated adjustments
of noncontrolled drug inventory in OTPS, might have been identified more quickly and then
properly documented and corrected.

In addition, once discrepancies between the perpetual and actual inventory balances are
identified, the hospital’s policy on “Adjustments to the OTPS Pharmacy Inventory” states: “An
investigation to determine the cause of the discrepancy must be investigated within 24 hours or the
next business day, to determine the cause of the discrepancy.” If there is documentation of the
discrepancy, it must be signed by pharmacy officials. All adjustments to OTPS inventory require
a brief explanation as to the reason for the adjustment. The purpose of this policy is “to provide
an accurate level of inventory control and to prevent the unlawful diversion of medications.”
Not only did we find extensive discrepancies in the inventory counts in our Fiscal Year 2007 testing,
we found no evidence that this policy was being followed.

Following the $2.34 million in gross adjustments made in January 2007, hospital officials made
additional unsubstantiated gross adjustments totaling $1.07 million in February and March 2007,
and $0.34 million in gross adjustments following the year-end count in June 2007. As stated in the
previous section of this report, the gross value of these inadequately documented adjustments
totaled $3.75 million. When asked about the specific adjustments, hospital",36932,5559

totaled $3.75 million. When asked about the specific adjustments, hospital officials did not
provide us with adequate documentation or explanations. Instead, the hospital conducted an
extensive analysis to try to account for these adjustments in inventory levels.

HHC Response: “From the date of the entrance conference, CIH officials informed the
auditors that the facility had conducted its own internal audit of the pharmacy’s internal
controls over non-controlled drugs. The facility’s audit identified issue sheets
(distributions made to units via signed documents that recognize the delivery and receipt
of non-controlled drugs) that were not being entered into the OTPS system, and that
inventory levels were being adjusted to match physical count values. As a result, the
facility started a reconciliation of its FY 2007 issue sheets to adjustments processed in the
OTPS system at the time your audit was first being conducted. Although the auditors
were alerted to these facts, very little is stated in the current report to recognize the fact
that CIH had already taken measures to identify and correct deficiencies.”

Auditor Comment: At our entrance conference in February 2007, HHC officials told us
that there were no prior, applicable audits or consultant reports on Inventory Controls of
Coney","Coney Island Hospital over Noncontrolled Drugs. At that time, we were asked to delay
our first meeting at the hospital for nearly a month until March 19, 2007 due to the
Pharmacy Director’s previously planned vacation. In March 2007, when we first met
with pharmacy officials at their facility, they mentioned that they were having a problem
with one clerk, but they failed to alert the audit team to the existence of the internal audit
report, the inventory adjustments, or the security measures, (i.e., the keycards and
cameras) that had been implemented since our entrance conference. We later learned
that, just ahead of our audit, pharmacy officials had started to review their inventory
controls and implement “corrective measures” due to the internal audit report, dated
January 31, 2007. Throughout this report, we mention the corrective measures taken,

and assigning different people to the responsibilities of ordering, receiving, issuing, and
recording transactions—the unexplained inventory discrepancies could have been reduced and
inventory records would have been more accurate and complete.

We conclude that during Fiscal Year 2007, Coney Island Hospital did not maintain
adequate controls over its noncontrolled drug inventory. The pharmacy staff did not enter
noncontrolled drug issues in a timely manner, nor did they document or adequately explain
inventory adjustments made in OTPS, as required by the hospital’s own policies. As a result, we

with pharmacy officials at their facility, they mentioned that they were having a problem
with one clerk, but they failed to alert the audit team to the existence of the internal audit
report, the inventory adjustments, or the security measures, (i.e., the keycards and
cameras) that had been implemented since our entrance conference. We later learned
that, just ahead of our audit, pharmacy officials had started to review their inventory
controls and implement “corrective measures” due to the internal audit report, dated
January 31, 2007. Throughout this report, we mention the corrective measures taken,

including: major changes in key personnel; new and updated written procedures for drug
handling; and the installation of a new security system. We also learned that during the
period of time that Coney","Coney Island Hospital requested we delay the audit, between February 15
and March 19, 2007, pharmacy personnel entered $1.07 million in adjustments.

The January 2007 hospital report had identified specific discrepancies in the inventory counts
of seven (35%) of 20 randomly selected items tested on January 18, 2007. On June 19, 2007,
five months later, we found that discrepancies still existed for six (86%) of these seven items. If
hospital management had implemented the recommendations within the internal report—such as
ensuring that the pharmacy enter all drug invoices and issue sheets into OTPS on a regular basis
and assigning different people to the responsibilities of ordering, receiving, issuing, and
recording transactions—the unexplained inventory discrepancies could have been reduced and
inventory records would have been more accurate and complete.

We conclude that during Fiscal Year 2007, Coney Island Hospital did not maintain
adequate controls over its noncontrolled drug inventory. The pharmacy staff did not enter
noncontrolled drug issues in a timely manner, nor did they document or adequately explain
inventory adjustments made in OTPS, as required by the hospital’s own policies. As a result, we
are unable to ascertain whether the discrepancies we identified are merely due to poor record
keeping or are indicative of more serious problems, such as theft.

The hospital pharmacy has also undergone a number of personnel changes both prior to
and during the course of this audit. The former pharmacy director retired in December 2005 and

The hospital pharmacy has also undergone a number of personnel changes both prior to
and during the course of this audit. The former pharmacy director retired in December 2005 and
the position remained vacant until a new director was appointed in March 2006, less than a year
before the start of our audit. During the audit, by April 2007, the pharmacy clerk responsible for
updating the OTPS inventory was transferred and replaced by two new clerks. Finally, the
hospital’s Deputy Chief Financial Officer retired in July 2007.

To determine the accuracy of the inventory records during the subsequent fiscal year (2008),
we randomly selected a sample of 111 noncontrolled drugs for a stockroom inventory count on
October 12, 2007. Of these 111 items, valued at $75,335, we found 13 (12%) had gross
discrepancies in counts between the perpetual inventory records in OTPS and the actual balances
tested in the pharmacy stockroom. We found shortages in seven items and overages in six
items. We estimated the gross value of these 13 discrepancies at $2",41866,6324

Prior to our count, hospital officials had not identified any of these discrepancies. After
investigating the discrepancies hospital officials provided documentation to resolve six. Again
these discrepancies were due to the same types of record keeping errors found during our
preliminary inventory count in June 2007, involving incorrect unit of issue, data entry mistakes,
and forgetting to enter invoices and/or issue sheets. However, hospital officials still could not
explain seven of the 13 gross discrepancies in counts.

Two additional tests also confirmed improvements in the accuracy of hospital’s inventory
records of noncontrolled drug inventory. The first test, in which we traced and vouched all
noncontrolled drug invoices and issue sheets for a randomly selected week, found that all (100%)
of the transactions were documented and had been accurately and completely entered in OTPS.
The second test, in which we followed up and retested all 41 items with discrepancies between
the perpetual inventory records in OTPS and the actual balances tested in the pharmacy
stockroom on June 19, 2007, found that only two items still had unexplained discrepancies in
October 2007.

Of the 41 noncontrolled drugs in this follow-up inventory count on October 12, 2007,
valued at $36,051, we found only two (5%) items had discrepancies between the perpetual
inventory records in OTPS and the actual balances tested in the pharmacy stockroom. We found
a shortage of one unit in one item and an overage of two units in the other item. We",43738,6629

a shortage of one unit in one item and an overage of two units in the other item. We estimated
the gross value of the discrepancies for the two items at $91 compared to a gross value of
$17,398 for the gross discrepancies in counts in these same 41 items in the June 2007
preliminary count detailed earlier in this report in Table I. The results of the October 2007

follow-up inventory count are shown in Table IV, below:

Based upon the results of these tests, the accuracy of its perpetual inventory records for
noncontrolled drugs has improved. However, this improvement in the accuracy of inventory
records may be a result of the auditors’ presence along with personnel changes and not due to
improvements in management controls over inventory.

HHC Response: “From December 2007 until June 2008, no further contact between the
audit team and the facility occurred. Instead of receiving a preliminary draft report which is
usually customary after a preliminary exit conference, the auditors returned in June 2008,
seven months later, to conduct a 100% review of the Pharmacy Department’s FY 2008
year-end inventory, which effectively changed the audit scope.”

## MG07_111A_page_18
Auditor Comment: We did not hold a “preliminary exit conference” with HHC. In
November 2007 we met with Hospital and HHC officials to inform them of our findings.
Subsequently, we met with HHC officials in January 2008 and were in contact via phone
with HHC and the hospital. Based on the significant findings revealed during our test of
the hospital’s Fiscal Year 2007 operations, we expanded the audit’s scope to include
Fiscal Year 2008, in order to test whether newly implemented changes in the pharmacy
had resulted in improved inventory controls. The audit team returned to the facility for
the year-end inventory count in June 2008, in order to ensure that the improvements
noted during the limited testing performed in October 2007 had not been temporary
adjustments due to our presence at the facility.

We returned to the hospital at Fiscal Year-end 2008 to document whether the accuracy of
the hospital’s perpetual inventory records continued to improve. Of the 1,101 noncontrolled
drugs tested, valued at $834,885, we found 9 (0.8%) items had discrepancies between the
perpetual inventory records in OTPS and the actual balances tested in the pharmacy stockroom.
We found shortages in eight items and an overage in only one item. We estimated the gross
value of these nine discrepancies at $1,857. The results of the Fiscal Year-end 2008 inventory
count are shown in Table V, below:

In addition, during Fiscal Year 2008, the hospital adjusted the balances of 10 noncontrolled
drugs with a total dollar value of $3,397. In view of these reductions in inventory discrepancies
and adjustments during Fiscal Year 2008, we are reasonably assured that the problems we
identified in Fiscal Year 2007 have been corrected and that the hospital has improved internal
controls over its inventory of noncontrolled drugs.

Large differences between the perpetual inventory records in OTPS and the actual
inventory balances in the pharmacy stockroom, as well as inadequately documented adjustments
to those records, not only interfere with effective inventory management, but also create an
environment susceptible to theft and misappropriation. In addition, adequate supervisory review
and accurate records would ensure early detection of missing items and would permit timely
investigations to identify the source of errors.

Recommendations
Coney Island Hospital should ensure that:

1. Transactions posted in OTPS are independently reviewed in a timely manner to
ensure records are complete and accurate.

HHC Response: HHC agreed and stated that as of July 2008, “The pharmacy
supervisor conducts weekly tests to monitor the timeliness and accuracy of entries
into OTPS”. In addition, as of December 2008, “the hospital’s Internal Auditor
conducts a sample audit to verify the accuracy of OTPS entries.”

All inventory adjustments posted in OTPS are properly authorized and have supporting

RE: = Draft Audit Report on inventory Controls Over

Non-Controlied Drugs at Coney island Hospital MG07-111A

Dear Mr. Graham:
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the above referenced audit.

| was pleased to read that after a thorough review and verification of Coney","Coney island
Hospital's (CIH) procedures, your audit found adequate internal controls existed over CIH’s Fiscal
Year 2008 pharmacy inventory. According to your 100% review of the facility's year-end inventory
valued at $834,885, there was a less than one percent (0.8%) error rate noted. Few instances {9
of 1,101 inventory items) were identified where minor discrepancies existed between the perpetual
record and physical count. The audit also acknowledged that all noncontrolled drugs are
maintained and stored in secured areas within the institution, monitored by security cameras 24
hours a day/7 days a week.

While we agree with certain findings and disagree with the reported severity of others, we
recognize the need for improvement. With respect to the deficiencies cited in your audit regarding
pharmacy inventory controls for Fiscal Year 2007, and those identified in CIH’s internal review,
corrective measures were already being initiated prior to the start of your FY 2007 and FY 2008
audits, In addition, a number of operating procedures and processes were developed to
strengthen and enhance internal controls over the facility's noncontrolled drug inventory.

Attachment | is the detailed response to the reported audit findings. Attachment II is the
Audit Implementation Plan, which addresses all the recammendations cited in the report.

Attachment I

The report states (page 1):

*  pharnacy staff made unsubstantiated inventory adjustments on several occasions, totaling an
estimated $3.75 million, to the noncontrolled drug perpetual inventory in OTPS to align it with
physical balances at the hospital...”

The report also states (pages 1-2):

“The hospital later reported to us that it conducted an analysis of the adjustments and
determined that $2.90 million was related to inventory issuances that had not been recorded in
OTPS. However, we were not provided sufficient information in order to determine the accuracy
of that analysis.” We disagree with the above statements for the following reasons:

First, the $3.75 million in adjustments incorrectly includes $110,000 for blood sugar test strips,
and intravenous solutions that are improperly included in the non-controlled drug category,
which according to the audit scope, should have been excluded. This was pointed out to the
auditors at the exit conference, and again in an earlier correspondence,

Minor incidents.

The priority level of a Service Restoration incident determines the time in which EITS should
resolve the issue so that the user can continue normal workflow. '°

Our analysis of EITS helpdesk statistics for Epic EMR-related Service Restoration incidents at
Elmhurst HC showed that a total of 16,922 issues were reported during the 12-month period April
2016 through March 2017. (See Appendix III for more detailed analysis of those statistics.) Each
of those incidents was assigned a ticket number by the EITS helpdesk facility for tracking
purposes. However, as reflected in Table III below, when we compared EITS’s Average Actual
times for resolving those Service Restoration issues with its target resolution times listed in the
SLA, we found that EITS’ actual resolution times significantly exceeded its SLA target times for
resolving incidents it classified as medium, high, or critical priority. Conversely, for low-priority
Service Resolution incidents, EITS’ average actual resolution time of 6 days was far less than the
allotted SLA target time of 30 days.

° The SLA Target times for tickets are measured on actual time 24/7/365. The SLA clock starts at the time of ticket creation and stops
once the ticket has been resolved, breached or has been marked as pending.

10 The allocated time, shown in the table as “SLA Target Turnaround Time,” is used by the helpdesk facility as (1) a performance
target for assisting users; and (2) a gauge for managing","managing the volume of users’ requests for assistance and allocating helpdesk resources
accordingly—an effort to match helpdesk resources with user requirements. In addition, the time frames allocated for the resolution
of “service restoration” incidents in each of the four designated incident priority levels form the basis of EITS’ SLA with its agency
users within H+H.

Appendix III of this report details Elmhurst HC Service Restoration incidents during the above 12-
month period, by month, priority categories, and age of the helpdesk tickets.

EITS is required to adhere to its SLA performance standards for incident management to support
Elmhurst HC’s Epic EMR users so that they can maintain proper patient care. Missing the SLA
target times for high- and critical-priority tickets can significantly impact multiple user-workflows,
especially when no alternatives or workarounds are available. Since Epic EMR is Elmhurst HC’s
primary, mission-critical EMR system, any incidents that are unresolved, or resolved in an
untimely manner, may have a material impact on patient care and patient safety.

Recommendation

1. EITS should assess its helpdesk operations with regard to the resolution of
reported Service Restoration incidents to identify the probable causes for missing
SLA targets, such as, if applicable, a lack of resources, inadequate",23425,3554
